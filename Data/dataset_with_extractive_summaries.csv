Eighteen mice were divided into three  groups: control, survival box, and clinostat + survival box. Behavioral tests, femur micro-CT, brain  transcriptomics, serum metabolomics, and fecal microbiomics were performed. Results showed  decreased activity, altered gait, enhanced fear memory, bone loss, immune/endocrine changes in brain  transcriptome, and altered metabolic pathways in serum and gut microbiota in clinostat-treated mice.  The model closely mimics spaceflight-induced transcriptome changes, suggesting its value in studying  microgravity-related neurological alterations and highlighting the need for attention to emotional  changes in space. Keywords Microgravity, Three-dimensional clinostat, Brain, Transcriptomics, Microbiomics, Serum  metabolomics, Animal model Space exploration is a long-term dream and pursuit of humanity, and it is also one of the important fields  of technological development. In long-term space flight, astronauts face many problems. One of them is the  reduction of gravitational force. Terrestrial life has evolved under the influence of gravity for millions of years, and  long-term microgravity represents unusual stress experiences that can cause physiological and morphological  changes1. Numerous studies have shown that long-term weightlessness can lead to various physiological and  pathological changes, such as the skeletal and muscular system, cardiovascular system, immune system, and  nervous system2. Prolonged exposure to microgravity during extended space missions poses various physiological  challenges to astronauts, necessitating thorough research into the effects of microgravity on the human body. One  of the crucial issues is the impact of long-term spaceflight on brain function. Studies have shown that astronauts  experience changes such as ataxia, posture disorders, perceptual illusions, fatigue, and cognitive impairment3.  The high cost and technical issues related to spaceflight have stimulated the development of ground models  that reasonably simulate the effects of space flight. Currently, tail-suspension hindlimb unloading is the most  classic and widely used model, particularly those affecting the musculoskeletal system4. However, this model has  certain limitations, that is, it can only be applied locally, and cannot be applied to the whole experimental animal.  Besides, there are physiological differences between hindlimb unloading models and spaceflight, especially in  terms of somatosensory input, spatial orientation, and vestibular disruption5. Three-dimensional (3D) clinostat is a device that generates multi-directional G forces. By controlling the  rotation on both axes, it can offset the cumulative gravity vector at the center of the device6. Previous studies  have shown that 3D clinostat have been widely used on plants, cells and Caenorhabditis elegans to simulate  microgravity effects7–9. Our previous studies suggest that the central nervous system probably changed in mice  trained with 3D clinostat10. Therefore, the aim of our work is to systematically assess 3D clinostat simulated  microgravity effect in mice by behavioral and multi group analysis, focusing on the changes in central nervous  system and cognitive function.

The mice were  randomly divided into three groups: (1) MC group with mice housed in ordinary cage (MC, n = 6); (2) SB group  with mice housed in survival box (SB, n = 6); (3) CS group with mice housed in survival box receiving 3D  clinostat treatment (CS, n = 6). The structure of the 3D clinostat and the survival box (shown in Supplementary  Figure S1) has been described in detail in our previous study10. The rotation modes are as follows: random  rotation speed, 0–10 rpm; speed resolution, 0.1 rpm. Before the study, all mice were acclimated to the facility  environment for 2 days and then adaptive training was carried out for 5 days to alleviate stress and adapt to the  jelly like diet containing 59% water, 1% agar, and 40% purified feed. During training, the CS group underwent  adaptive rotation for 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 12 h each day, while the MC group was always placed in ordinary cage  and the SB group was always placed in survival boxes without any treatment. The formal experiments began at  11 weeks old. The CS group experienced continuous simulated microgravity effect on clinostat for 8 weeks with  the exception of cleaning cages and changing food for approximately 20 min per day; the other two groups of  mice always lived in corresponding living facilities in the same room. To avoid the interference of acute stress,  weight monitoring showed that the body weight of mice in the CS group gradually returned to the control  group level after 28 days, suggesting that the mice had fully adapted to the 3D clinostat. Starting from the fifth  week, mice underwent a series of behavioral experiments. Following each behavioral experiment, the mice were  promptly placed into a 3D clinostat to ensure continuous microgravity effect stimulation. After 8 weeks, the  mice were euthanized dissected for sampling at the end of the experiment (Fig.  1a). Animal care was provided in  accordance with institutional guidelines and all animal studies were performed in compliance with the ARRIVE  guidelines and were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Laboratory of Animal Science of Peking Union  Medical College (IACUC-20220415). Mouse behavioral tests The sequence of the behavioral experiments was arranged as follows: Grip strength experiment (day 29), Open  field test (day 30), Novel object recognition test (day 30–32), Y-Maze (day 33), Elevated plus maze (day 34), Tail  suspension test (day 35), Gait analysis (day 36–40), Rotarod test (day 42–44), Morris water maze (day 45–51),  Forced swim test (day 52) and Fear conditioning test (day 53–56). Each mouse was tested individually and then  put back into the 3D clinostat as soon as possible after the test to minimize the time spent disengaging from the  rotation. Fig. 1 .

The data are  presented as the mean ± SD, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001, n = 6 for each group.  Scientific Reports  |         (2025) 15:5731 2 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-90212-ywww.nature.com/scientificreports/ Detailed methods of behavioral testing are as follows: Grip strength experiment The evaluation of grip strength was conducted using a grip strength meter. Each animal was individually placed  on the grip strength board and pulled by the tail, prompting them to grasp the bar. The rodents instinctively  grasp anything in order to prevent this involuntary backward movement until the pulling force exceeds their  grip strength. The maximum value of grip strength was recorded using the Bioseb system. Each animal was  tested three times repeatedly, and the mean value was calculated. During the behavioral testing time, each mouse  was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 15 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D  clinostat device after testing. Open field test The open field was an empty square environment, with a size of 50 cm × 50 cm × 30 cm. A central area was  marked in the open field, centered in the middle of the empty space, with a square length of 16 cm zone. The  fringe area was 10 cm wide. The animals were placed in the middle of the central area and observed for five  minutes. Behavioral parameters including velocity, distance traveled, and time spent in the central and fringe  areas were recorded by a computerized video tracking system (Ethovision XT; Noldus, Information Technology,  The Netherlands). The open field apparatus was cleaned after each session using 70% ethanol and allowed to dry  between tests. During the behavioral testing time, each mouse was removed from the 3D clinostat device for  about 20 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat device after testing. Novel object recognition test The novel object recognition test was used to assess short- and long-term recognition memory. The experimental  procedure consisted of three stages. On the first day, there was an adaptation period without any toy bricks. On  the second day, familiarization took place with two toy bricks (2 cm × 2 cm) in opposite corners, both with the  same shape, size, and color. On the third day, the test period occurred, with one of the toy bricks changed to  a different shape and color. The camera on top of the box was used to record how long it took for a mouse to  examine the new object (TN) and the familiar object (TF), allowing a total of five minutes for exploring the two  distinct objects. The recognition index was calculated as follows: Recognition index = (TN/(TN + TF)) × 100%. A  higher recognition index reflected better short- and long-term recognition memory abilities in animals within  this group. The behavioral test time was about 20  min per day for each mouse to be removed from the 3D  clinostat for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat after testing. Y-maze In the Y-maze test, each mouse was placed at the end of one arm of the 'Y' and allowed to explore the maze  freely for five minutes. The sequence of entry of the mice in the arms was recorded to calculate the percentage  of change. The mouse entered three different arms in turn, which was counted as one alternation. Spontaneous  alternations (%) = Number of spontaneous alternations/(Total number of arm entries − 2) *100%. Higher  spontaneous alternations indicated better learning and memory ability. During the behavioral testing time, each  mouse was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 20 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the  3D clinostat device after testing. Elevated plus maze During the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) test, the maze was composed of four arms (30 cm × 5 cm). Two opposite  arms were closed, enclosed by lateral walls (depth 5 cm), and the remaining two arms were open and lacked  walls. The four arms were connected by a central area (5 cm × 5 cm), and the maze was elevated 50 cm from  the floor. During the test, mice were placed on the central square platform and allowed to explore the maze for  5 min. The following parameters were recorded and analyzed: the number of entries into open/closed arms, the  time spent in the open/closed arms, and the total number of arm entries. These data were recorded by a camera  and analyzed using a computerized video tracking system. The anxiety index was calculated as the ratio of open arm time and entries to total time and total entries. The  open arm entries percent was calculated as entries into the open arm divided by the total number of arm entries  (entries into the open arm + entries into the closed arm). During the behavioral testing time, each mouse was  removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 20 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat  device after testing. Tail suspension test The Tail Suspension Test was performed as previously described11. Adhesive tape was applied to the tail,  approximately 1 cm from the tip, and the mouse was suspended for 6 min. After a 2 min habituation period, the  immobility time was recorded during the final 4 min using Tail Suspension Real-Time Analysis (System-2.0).  During the behavioral testing time, each mouse was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 20 min for  testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat device after testing. Gait analysis The gait of naturally moving mice was analyzed using CatWalk XT (Noldus Information Technology,  Netherlands), as previously described12. This gait analysis system consists of a glass walkway floor illuminated  with a green light that is completely internally reflected in the glass, a standard charge-coupled device (CCD)  camera underneath, and software for recording and analyzing the data obtained from mouse paws. A darkroom  box was used at the end of the walkway to create an incentive for the mice to cross the field, where the entrance  Scientific Reports  |         (2025) 15:5731 3 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-90212-ywww.nature.com/scientificreports/ to their home cage is placed. The mice were placed in the front of the start zone of the walkway and were trained  to cross the walkway with five accomplished runs per day on five consecutive days. The test was started on the  fifth day, and each mouse was tested three times. The successful run was defined as a mouse walking across the  runway without any hesitation. The walkway was cleaned thoroughly with 70% ethanol between each animal.  Gait parameters of footprints were automatically generated (left front, LF; left hind, LH; right front, RF; and  right hind, RH). The behavioral test time was about 20 min per day for each mouse to be removed from the 3D  clinostat for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat after testing. Rotarod test The rotarod apparatus (Model: 47600, Italy) was used to assess the locomotor abilities of rodents, particularly  their coordination and endurance. Mice were subjected to a training session of four trials per day for 3 days, the  rotarod gradually accelerated from 5 to 40 rpm within 120 s until the mouse fell off. Starting from the 4th day  after training, formal testing experiments were conducted. During test trial, the rotarod gradually accelerated  from 5 to 40 rpm within 300 s. The latency at which the mouse fell from the rod (or a maximum of 5 min) was  recorded. The average latency from three trials was determined. During the behavioral testing time, each mouse  was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 30 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D  clinostat device after testing. Morris water maze The water maze was divided into four quadrants and contained a platform that remained submerged under  1–1.5 cm of water. During the training trials, mice were placed in the water from the opposite quadrant of the  platform. Successful navigation to the platform was considered when the mouse found it within 1 min. If the  mouse failed to find the platform within this time limit, a guidance rod was used to guide the mouse to stay on  the platform for 10 s and the latency was recorded as 60 s. Training trials were conducted for three trial sessions  each day for six consecutive days. During probe trials, the platform was removed from the maze. Frequency of  visits to the platform, time spent in the platform quadrant, cumulative duration in the target zone, and latency  to the platform were used as indicators of memory performance. The behavioral test time was about 30 min per  day for each mouse to be removed from the 3D clinostat for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat  after testing. Forced swim test The forced swim test was performed as previous studies13. Each mouse was individually placed into a non- transparent cylindrical plastic container (height of 25  cm; diameter of 18  cm) containing 15  cm of water at  23–25 °C. The test duration was 6 min, and immobility was analyzed during the last 4 min. Immobility behavior  was considered by inactive time when the animal remained floating passively without any movements, with the  exception of minimal movements to keep the head above water. During the behavioral testing time, each mouse  was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 20 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D  clinostat device after testing. Fear conditioning test Both contextual and cued fear conditioning protocols were implemented as previous studies14. On the first  day, mice were introduced to a Plexiglas training cage under constant illumination for 5 min. On the second  day, animals were allowed to adapt for 180 s in the box before commencing three to five rounds of circulation  training. Auditory stimulation (30 s, 5 kHz, 70 dB) was then administered, followed by the delivery of electric  current stimulation (0.65 mA, 1 s). The intervals between each training session were 30–60 s. Animals were  allowed to remain in the cage for 30 s before being returned to their home cage. Twenty-four hours later, a  contextual fear conditioning test was conducted by placing animals back into the same training cage without  any sound or electric current stimulation, and their freezing behavior was recorded over a 330 s period. On  the fourth day, cued fear conditioning began. The background and smell of the boxes were changed, and after  180 s of adaptation in the box, only auditory stimulation (5 kHz, 70 dB) was presented. Freezing behavior was  then recorded over a 420 s period. Prior to each animal’s placement, the fear-conditioning box was thoroughly  cleaned with 70% ethanol. The behavioral test time was about 20 min per day for each mouse to be removed from  the 3D clinostat for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat after testing. Brain transcriptomics Brain samples were bisected along the plane separating the hemispheres. For each brain, one hemisphere was  selected for the generation of mRNA sequencing data, following a methodology similar to that described in  the previously published paper15. Total RNA extraction was carried out using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,  CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s protocol. To assess the quality and quantity of the extracted RNA, the  NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) was employed. The integrity of the RNA was then  evaluated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Subsequently, RNA  libraries were constructed with the V AHTS Universal V6 RNA-seq Library Prep Kit, strictly adhering to the  manufacturer’s instructions. The transcriptome sequencing and subsequent analysis were conducted by OE Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai,  China). The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform, generating 150  bp paired-end  reads. The raw reads in fastq format underwent an initial processing step using fastp. During this process, low- quality reads were filtered out to obtain clean reads suitable for further analysis. The clean reads were then  mapped to the reference genome using HISAT2. To quantify gene expression levels, the FPKM of each gene  was calculated and the read counts for each gene were obtained via HTSeq-count. To evaluate the biological  Scientific Reports  |         (2025) 15:5731 4 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-90212-ywww.nature.com/scientificreports/ duplication of the samples, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed using the R programming  language (version 3.2.0). For the differential expression analysis, the DESeq2 package was utilized. Genes were  considered significantly differentially expressed if they met the criteria of a P value < 0.05 and a fold change > 1.5  or fold change < 0.667. Bioinformatic analysis and graphics was performed using the OECloud tools at  h t t p s : / / c  l o u d . o e b i o t e c h . c o m / t a s k /     .   The hindlimb unloading mice and real spaceflight microgravity mice brain transcriptome data have been  sourced from published data. Specifically, the brain RNA-seq data of hindlimb unloading mice, which underwent  hindlimb unloading for 2 weeks and had their total RNA extracted from each brain using Trizol for transcriptome  analysis (GeneLab ID: GLDS-32, https:// doi.org/10.26030/jpyz-fn46 ), and the data from spaceflight mice, that  were housed in the Rodent Habitat for 39–42 days, euthanized in space (mice were anesthetized by ketamine/ xylazine/acepromazine and subjected to cardiac puncture followed by cervical dislocation), and had their whole  carcasses stored at − 80 °C during the Rodent Research-3 mission (GeneLab ID: GLDS-352,  h t t p s : / / d o  i . o r g / 1 0  . 2 6 0 3 0 / j m 5 9 - z y 5 4     ) , are both accessible within the NASA Open Science Data Repository  (   h t t p s : / / o s  d r . n a s a . g o v  / b i o     ) . Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2. P value < 0.05 and foldchange > 1.5 or  foldchange < 0.667 was set as the threshold for significantly differential expression gene. Bioinformatic analysis  and graphics was performed using the OECloud tools at https://cloud.oebiotech.com/task/ . To compare the differences between three models, namely the 3D clinostat model (CS), hindlimb  unloading model (HU), and space flight mice (FL), we conducted a distance comparison of transcriptome  changes. Select shared genes from transcriptome data for analysis, and obtain log2FoldChang values for each  gene, namely FCCS(1,2,3…n), FCHU(1,2,3…n), FCFL(1,2,3…n), and then calculate the brain transcriptome  distance between each model, SCS/FL = ∑n 1|FCcsn−FCFLn|, SHU/FL = ∑n 1|FCHUn−FCFLn|,  SCS/HU = ∑n 1|FCcsn−FCHUn|. The similarity of the three models can be compared by the magnitude of the  distance value S. By utilizing the multiple expression changes of each gene in different models relative to their  respective control groups, a heatmap can be drawn to visually display and compare the differences in the brain  transcriptome of each model. Serum metabolomics To extract metabolites, 400 μl of cold extraction solvent methanol/acetonitrile/H2O (2:2:1) was added to 100 μl  of serum sample and adequately vortexed. The samples were then incubated on ice for 20 min and centrifuged  at 14,000 g for 20  min at 4  °C. The supernatant was dried in a vacuum centrifuge. For LC–MS analysis, the  samples were re-dissolved in 100 μL acetonitrile/water (1:1, v/v) solvent and centrifuged at 14,000 g at 4 °C for  15 min, then the supernatant was injected. For the untargeted metabolomics of polar metabolites, extracts were  analyzed using a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Sciex Triple TOF 6600) coupled to hydrophilic  interaction chromatography via electrospray ionization by the Shanghai Applied Protein Technology Co. Ltd.  Preparation of QC samples by mixing aliquots of all samples. The raw LC–MS data obtained were processed  using Proqenesis QI Software (Waters Corporation Milford, USA). For statistical analysis, we made use of  both univariate (Student’s t-test and fold change analysis) and multivariate (principal component analysis and  orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis) method. The variable importance in projection (VIP)  scores > 1 and P values < 0.05, and fold change > 2 or < 0.5 were used to filter the differential metabolites. For the  KEGG annotation of metabolic pathways, the metabolites were compared against the online KEGG database  using BLAST to retrieve their COs, and then mapped to the corresponding KEGG pathways16–18. Analysis of the diversity of gut microbiota in feces OE biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) conducted the 16S amplicon sequencing and analysis. Briefly,  genomic DNA was extracted from fecal samples using the DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) and  its concentration and purity were assessed by NanoDrop 2000 (Agilent, USA). The extracted DNA was used  as template for PCR amplification of bacterial 16S rRNA with universal primers for V3-V4 variable regions.  Sequencing was performed by Illuminaa NovaSeq 6000 with 250  bp paired-end reads. The raw sequencing  data, in FASTQ format, were preprocessed using Cutadapt software to remove adapters. Following trimming,  low-quality sequences were filtered out, and the remaining reads were denoised, merged, and chimera-checked  using DADA2 with default QIIME2 parameters. The software ultimately output representative reads and an  ASV abundance table. The representative read of each ASV was selected using the QIIME2 package, and all  representative reads were annotated against the Silva database using q2-feature-classifier. Micro-CT imaging of bone The femoral bone was dissected of soft tissues, fixed in formalin and the distal metaphysis scanned with a Siemens  INVEON scanner using the following settings: tube voltage, 60 kV; tube current, 400 µA; and exposure time,  800 ms over 360° rotation. The Feldkamp filtered back-projection algorithm was used to reconstruct the images  to generate 3D reconstructions. Images acquired from the scanner were viewed and calculated morphometric  parameters with INVEON Workplace software. Statistical analysis The data are shown as means ± SD. GraphPad Prism 10.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Two-way  ANOV A followed by post-hoc test evaluated the significance of differences between groups. A difference was  considered significant if the P value < 0.05. Scientific Reports  |         (2025) 15:5731 5 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-90212-ywww.nature.com/scientificreports/ Results Effects of 3D clinostat on the body weight and general status in mice Figure  1b showed the daily changes in weight of mice over the first 4 weeks. The SB group mice exhibited a weight  profile similar to that of the MC group, indicating good adaptability to survival box. In contrast, the CS group  mice undergoing 3D clinostat initially experienced a significant weight loss during the first 4 days. However,  these mice gradually adapted to the 3D clinostat and their weight stabilized, followed by a slow recovery to levels  similar to those of the SB control group and MC control group. Overall, the mice appeared healthy throughout  the study period, indicating good adaptability to the 3D clinostat instrument. The impact of 3D clinostat on cognitive and motor related behavior We conducted a series of behavioral experiments to observe the 3D clinostat simulated microgravity effect on  cognitive and motor related behaviors in mice. The results showed 3D clinostat treatment significantly reduced  mice activity and exploratory desire, indicated by the significant reduction in movement distance and exercise  time in the open field test as shown in Fig.  1c–d, as well as in other behavioral experiments, including Y Maze,  elevated plus maze and novel object recognition test (data not shown). In terms of learning and memory, there  were no statistically significant differences in the recognition index in novel object recognition test (Fig.  1e),  the spontaneous alternations index in the Y maze (Fig.  1f), and the latency to the platform in the Morris water  maze (Fig.  1g) between CS and SB group, suggesting that 3D clinostat did not have a significant impact on the  learning and memory. Regarding motor ability, a series of tests including grip strength test, rotarod test, and gait  analysis were conducted. The results of the grip strength test revealed no notable differences among the three  groups of mice (Fig.  2a). In the rotarod test, mice in the SB group exhibited a significantly shorter latency to fall  compared to those in the MC group. This shorter latency may be attributed to the restricted activity space within  the survival box for the SB group mice. Conversely, the CS group mice displayed a significantly longer latency  to fall compared to the SB group, potentially due to their gradually acquired balancing ability through the 3D  clinostat process (Fig.  2b). Besides, gait analysis revealed significant changes in certain gait parameters in the CS  group compared to the SB group, indicating that prolonged exposure to the 3D clinostat had a notable impact on  the vestibular balance system (Table 1, with the raw data shown in Supplementary Table S1). In terms of anxiety  and depression, we conducted a series of experiments including the forced swim test, tail suspension test, and  Fig. 2 . Behavioral test results.

The data are presented as the mean ± SD, * P < 0.05, **  P < 0.01, ***  P < 0.001, n = 6 for each group.  Scientific Reports  |         (2025) 15:5731 6 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-90212-ywww.nature.com/scientificreports/ elevated plus maze. The results indicated that there were no statistically significant differences among the three  groups of mice in terms of the duration of immobility in both the forced swim test and tail suspension test, as  well as the percentage of open arm entries in the elevated plus maze. These findings suggest that exposure to  the 3D clinostat did not result in significant depression or anxiety tendencies (Fig.  2, c-e). However, in the fear  conditioning test, the 3D clinostat seemed to induce a trend towards increased sensitivity to fear behavior and  enhanced fear memory. During the fear memory learning phase, the CS group mice exhibited a notable increase  in freezing rates (Fig.  2f), coupled with a tendency of increased freezing rates in the contextual memory phase  (Fig.  2g). Especially during the extinction phase, CS mice still demonstrated a significant increase in freezing  rate, indicating enhanced fear memory and weakened extinction (Fig.  2h). Additionally, an increasing trend  in freezing rate was also observed in the CS group mice during the subsequent sound stimulus phase (Fig.  2i).  Upon comprehensive analysis of the behavioral research, it can be concluded that the 3D clinostat did not exert  a notable influence on learning and memory processes. However, it potentially influenced the fear behavioral,  along with subtle alterations related to motor balance. The impact of 3D clinostat on femur parameter To investigate the effects of 3D clinostat on bone metabolism, we utilized micro-CT to scan the femurs of mice  and analyzed changes in parameters such as bone volume, tissue volume, trabecular pattern factor, trabecular  number, and trabecular separation. The results revealed that both SB and CS group of mice exhibited significant  bone loss compared to the MC group, with a notable decrease in bone volume and trabecular number, as well as  a significant increase in trabecular pattern factor and trabecular separation. Furthermore, compared to the SB  group, the CS group displayed a trend of further aggravating bone loss (Fig.  3). The impact of 3D clinostat on brain transcriptome To evaluate the impact of 3D clinostat on the central nervous system, we conducted whole brain transcriptome  sequencing. The results showed that there were 568, 320, and 426 significantly different genes between each  group respectively, as shown in Fig.  4a. Figure  4b displays a heatmap of gene expression among the three groups  for 320 genes that exhibited significant differences between the CS and SB groups. To further analyze the impact  of 3D clinostat on the brain, we conducted KEGG pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes, as  shown in Fig.  4 c. 3D clinostat may primarily affect immune and endocrine-related signaling pathways, such  as those associated with human diseases like Malaria, African trypanosomiasis, Autoimmune thyroid disease,  Rheumatoid arthritis, and Staphylococcus aureus infection, as well as GnRH secretion and signaling pathway,  Ovarian steroidogenesis, IL17 signaling pathway, Prolactin signaling pathway, Leukocyte transendothelial  migration, PPAR signaling pathway, and Neutrophil extracellular trap formation.Gait parameters MC (Mean ± SD) SB (Mean ± SD) CS (Mean ± SD) P (CS vs SB) P (CS vs MC) P (SB vs MC) RF_PrintArea_(cm2)_Mean 0.272 ± 0.05 0.33 ± 0.051 0.248 ± 0.04 0.011 0.379 0.075 RH_MaxContactMaxIntensity_Mean 188.768 ± 6.89 183.125 ± 11.22 161.284 ± 15.857 0.02 0.003 0.319 RH_PrintLength_(cm)_Mean 0.839 ± 0.067 0.9 ± 0.069 0.816 ± 0.056 0.045 0.544 0.151 RH_PrintWidth_(cm)_Mean 0.656 ± 0.065 0.69 ± 0.044 0.62 ± 0.032 0.01 0.24 0.315 RH_MaxIntensity_Mean 193.748 ± 5.502 190.474 ± 7.926 167.327 ± 14.86 0.007 0.002 0.425 RH_MeanIntensityOfThe15MostIntensePixels_Mean 140.141 ± 8.092 133.75 ± 12.955 117.26 ± 12.025 0.045 0.003 0.33 LF_MaxContactArea_(cm2)_Mean 0.27 ± 0.03 0.282 ± 0.03 0.203 ± 0.038 0.003 0.007 0.502 LF_MaxContactMaxIntensity_Mean 165.715 ± 7.093 163.407 ± 7.699 141.793 ± 12.683 0.005 0.002 0.601 LF_MaxContactMeanIntensity_Mean 73.476 ± 3.211 74.367 ± 1.985 68.693 ± 3.993 0.011 0.045 0.576 LF_PrintLength_(cm)_Mean 0.888 ± 0.041 0.899 ± 0.078 0.762 ± 0.086 0.016 0.009 0.756 LF_PrintWidth_(cm)_Mean 0.754 ± 0.024 0.724 ± 0.063 0.644 ± 0.049 0.032 0.001 0.311 LF_PrintArea_(cm2)_Mean 0.329 ± 0.023 0.343 ± 0.036 0.241 ± 0.043 0.001 0.001 0.464 LF_MaxIntensity_Mean 174.92 ± 5.798 172.154 ± 8.777 150.079 ± 12.159 0.005 0.001 0.534 LF_MeanIntensity_Mean 76.797 ± 3.606 77.881 ± 2.337 72.247 ± 3.764 0.011 0.058 0.55 LH_MaxContactAt_(%)_Mean 29.644 ± 5.177 33.255 ± 5.425 44.056 ± 4.805 0.004 0.001 0.265 LH_MaxContactMaxIntensity_Mean 183.908 ± 10.444 183.98 ± 12.199 162.862 ± 10.968 0.01 0.007 0.991 LH_MaxIntensity_Mean 190.195 ± 7.764 191.693 ± 10.184 168.907 ± 11.337 0.004 0.004 0.78 LH_MeanIntensity_Mean 86 ± 3.002 85.876 ± 3.614 80.019 ± 1.755 0.005 0.002 0.95 LH_MeanIntensityOfThe15MostIntensePixels_Mean 135.542 ± 11.122 134.115 ± 9.127 116.662 ± 6.608 0.004 0.005 0.813 LH_StrideLength_(cm)_Mean 9.191 ± 2.131 10.083 ± 2.434 7.417 ± 0.962 0.032 0.093 0.514 BOS_HindPaws_Mean_(cm) 2.474 ± 0.108 2.477 ± 0.124 2.121 ± 0.142 0.001 0.001 0.966 PhaseDispersions_LH- > RH_Mean 48.759 ± 4.405 41.419 ± 7.088 48.738 ± 2.503 0.038 0.992 0.057 Couplings_LH- > LF_Mean 51.895 ± 2.686 57.778 ± 7.854 49.51 ± 3.672 0.042 0.228 0.113 Table 1 .

OPLS-DA analysis revealed distinct differentiation among the  three groups (Fig.  4d). Notably, in comparison to the SB group, the CS group exhibited significant upregulation  of serum metabolites such as Lys-Leu, 2-keto-D-Gluconic acid, Thyroxine 4’-o-.beta.-d-glucuronide, Beta- octylglucoside, Demissidine, Pro-Trp, and Pentobarbital. Conversely, serum metabolites including Poricoic acid  a, L-Lysine, Oleic acid, Ile-Pro, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-n,n-dimethyl, Niacinamide,  and 1-(1z-octadecenyl)-2-(4z,7z,10z,13z,16z,19z-docosahexaenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were  significantly downregulated (Fig.  4e). These alterations primarily implicate pathways such as ABC transporters,  Sphingolipid signaling pathway and metabolism, Biotin metabolism, and the Pentose phosphate pathway  (Fig.  4f). The impact of 3D clinostat on microbiome To investigate the impact of 3D clinostat on the gastrointestinal microbiota, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed  on mouse feces samples, revealing 333 ± 23, 273 ± 36, and 267 ± 43 ASVs detected in each group, respectively. In  terms of alpha diversity, the fecal microbiota richness was observed to be higher in the MC group compared  to the SB and CS groups (Fig.  5b). However, no significant differences were observed in the Shannon index  among the three groups (Fig.  5c). Regarding beta diversity, PCA analysis demonstrated distinct segregation of  the fecal microbiota profiles among the three groups (Fig.  5a). At the genus level, Fig.  6d illustrated the top 10  differentially abundant bacterial genera among the three groups. Notably, the Bacteroides  and Turicibacter  were  significantly reduced in the CS group compared to both the SB and MC groups (Fig.  5d). Functional analysis  of the microbial community was conducted using the PICRUSt2 software. The results indicated significant  differences in KEGG signaling pathways between the CS and SB groups, specifically in Ferroptosis, PPAR  signaling pathway, Lysosome, Glycosaminoglycan degradation, Lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, and Other  glycan degradation (Fig.  5e). These findings provide valuable insights into the effects of 3D clinostat on the  Fig. 3 . Changes in femoral bone parameters by micro-CT scanning.

Comparison of 3D clinostat simulated microgravity effect model with classical hindlimb  unloading model and spaceflight mice. To comprehensively assess the validity of the 3D clinostat simulated microgravity effect model, we conducted a  comparative analysis of mRNA expression profiles in brain tissue, juxtaposing our findings with those derived  from literature on hindlimb unloading (HU) mice and spaceflight (FL) mice models. The study revealed minimal  overlap among the three models, underscoring substantial variations. Specifically, eight differentially expressed  genes (Ibsp, Adam3, Xlr3b, G530011O06Rik, Wdr62, Cd22, Gm4675, and Nusap1) were shared between the  CS and FL models, whereas only two genes (Serpinc1 and Ccl19) overlapped between the HU and FL models.  Notably, no shared differentially expressed genes were identified between the CS and HU models, highlighting  notable disparities between these two models (Fig.  6a). These findings imply that neither the CS nor the HU  model perfectly recapitulates the complex effects of actual space microgravity on the brain, albeit the CS model  demonstrates relatively greater fidelity compared to the HU model. With respect to the functional disparities among genes, the HU model predominantly features genes tied to  neurodegenerative disorders, whereas the FL model encompassed a diverse array of genes related to immunity,  endocrinology, cardiovascular functions, and beyond. Among the top 20 KEGG pathways, the GnRH signaling  pathway stands out as a significantly altered pathway across all three models, highlighted in red. Notably, the  CS and FL models share additional two commonly altered pathways: Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction  and Ovarian steroidogenesis, both denoted with blue. Furthermore, Diabetic cardiomyopathy, indicated with  green, emerges as a shared altered pathway between the CS and HU models. These observations imply that the  CS model exhibited a greater degree of similarity to the FL model in comparison to the HU model (Fig.  6b–c). To compare the differences in brain gene expression profiles across these three models, we  performed a comprehensive distance comparison involving 5687 genes that were consistently detected  in all models. The results of this analysis are as follows: SCS/FL = ∑n 1|FCcsn−FCFLn|= 747 .25,  SHU/FL = ∑n 1|FCHUn−FCFLn|= 1756 .26, and SCS/HU = ∑n 1|FCcsn−FCHUn|= 1575 .88. Notably,  the SCS/FL distance emerges as significantly smaller than the SHU/FL distance, underscoring the closer resemblance  of the CS model to the FL model in terms of gene expression patterns. Additionally, by generating a heatmap  Fig. 4 . Alterations in brain transcriptome and serum metabolome of mice subjected to 3D clinostat.

Discussion This study explored the impact of simulated microgravity effect using a 3D clinostat on mice, with a particular  focus on behavioral, metabolic, gut microbiome and brain transcriptome changes. Our findings revealed that  the simulated microgravity effect induced by the 3D clinostat triggered noteworthy transformations within the  central nervous system. This model has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for investigating cognitive changes  associated with microgravity environments, while also offering new insights into the potential mechanisms  underlying spaceflight-related health risks. In this study, the behavioral experiments demonstrated that the 3D clinostat had a significant impact on  the physical activity and exploratory behavior. The observed reduction in movement distance and exercise  time in the open field test, combined with similar findings in the Y Maze, elevated plus maze, and novel object  recognition tests, suggests a marked decrease in the overall motivation and exploratory drive. These results are  consistent with existing literature on the effects of microgravity, where diminished activity levels and altered  behavioral patterns have been reported19–21. For instance, mice displayed similar declines in exploratory behavior  after a 30-day spaceflight on Bion-M1 satellite21. Different from past results, we did not find obvious anxiety or  depression in mice20,22,23. It is known that chronic restraint can lead to anxiety and depression24. We speculate  that the anxiety or depression emotion of animals found in the HU model might be caused by tail suspension  and restraint, rather than the direct effect of microgravity. The absence of notable disparities in learning and memory between the CS and SB groups, as assessed by the  Morris water maze and other memory related tests, might initially seem surprising. One would expect that the  reduced physical activity and altered emotional states might extend to cognitive functions. However, the results  suggest that the impact of microgravity on cognition might be more complex, potentially involving compensatory  mechanisms that preserve cognitive abilities despite changes in other behavioral domains. This finding aligns  with studies in which astronauts, despite experiencing emotional and physical stressors, often maintain cognitive  performance during space missions, possibly due to intensive training and adaptation processes25. In fact, there  are indeed some controversies about the effects of microgravity on cognitive function25–27. During spaceflights,  the overall cognitive performance of astronauts does not show significant decline, but their cognitive function  declines notably after returning to Earth25. Wollseiffen et al. found that neurocognitive performance can even be  Fig. 5 . Changes in the fecal microbiome of of mice subjected to 3D clinostat.

The adaptive changes such as changes  in brain blood supply caused by re-adaptation to the gravitational environment after the flight, rather than  microgravity itself, may be the key factors that lead to changes in cognitive function. Besides, it is also possible  that the short duration of microgravity effect exposure in our study was insufficient to produce detectable  cognitive deficits. Future studies with prolonged exposure and more sensitive cognitive assessments might reveal  subtle impairments not captured in this study. The motor coordination and balance tests, such as the rotarod and gait analysis, indicated subtle yet  significant changes in the vestibular system of the mice. These alterations are particularly relevant given the  well-documented vestibular dysfunctions reported by astronauts during and after space missions29. The role  of vestibular system in spatial orientation and balance is crucial, and its disruption in microgravity can lead to  disorientation, dizziness, and impaired motor function30. Under the premise that there was no significant change  in grip strength, our findings indicated that the latency to fall in the rotarod test for CS group was increased  compared to SB group, suggesting an adaptation or learning process that may mimic the vestibular compensation  observed in astronauts. This adaptive response could be due to the continuous 3D clinostat environment, which  might induce a reorganization of neural circuits involved in balance and coordination. Interestingly, the fear conditioning test showed that the 3D clinostat treated mice exhibited an increased  sensitivity to fear stimuli and enhanced fear memory. This observation might be linked to changes in the  amygdala and related brain structures, which are critical for processing fear and stress responses31. Research on  rats has revealed significant alterations in amygdala neural activity after landing, marked by Fos-positive cells,  suggesting a potential impact on fear-related emotional responses32,33. In 15 days of –6° head-down bed rest,  volunteers showed temporal overestimation of the fear stimuli in the middle phase34. This finding has important  implications for understanding the psychological and emotional challenges faced by astronauts during long- term space missions, where prolonged exposure to microgravity could exacerbate stress and anxiety, potentially  impairing mission performance and well-being. In the conditioned fear experiment, the most significant  difference between the CS and SB groups occurred during the fear extinction phase, suggesting an attenuation  of fear memory extinction. The specific neural circuit mechanisms underlying this phenomenon require further  in-depth research. In terms of bone density, mice in the CS group exhibited a decrease in bone volume and trabecular number,  accompanied by a notable increase in trabecular pattern factor and trabecular separation, indicating bone loss  Fig. 6 .

However, despite a seemingly more pronounced tendency  towards bone loss in the CS group compared to the SB group, no statistically significant difference was observed.  This may be attributed to the enhanced gripping and limb loading during the 3D clinostat process, as the mice  attempted to counteract the body repositioning caused by the rotation. In the rotarod test, the prolonged fall  latency observed in mice from the CS group, as well as subtle gait alterations detected in gait analysis, may also be  associated with the similar underlying reasons. On the other hand, the restricted space within the survival box  likely constrained the motor abilities of the SB group mice, and simultaneously induced bone loss in these mice.  This could potentially account for the reduced difference between the CS and SB groups, representing another  plausible explanation. The transcriptomic analysis of the brain tissues revealed significant changes in gene expression associated  with immune response, endocrine signaling, and nervous system functions. These alterations suggested that the  simulated microgravity effect triggered a broad and complex biological response, affecting multiple systems that  are crucial for maintaining homeostasis and health. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have  reported immune dysregulation and hormonal imbalances in response to microgravity in spaceflight animal  models35,36. Immune dysregulation and hormonal imbalances could lead to a range of health problems, including  increased susceptibility to infections, metabolic disorders, and mental health issues. Effective monitoring and  the development of targeted interventions could help mitigate these risks and improve the health of astronauts. One of the key findings of this study is the differential gene expression pattern observed in the CS model  compared to the HU and FL models. The minimal overlap in differentially expressed genes between these models  highlights the distinct biological effects induced by each type of simulated microgravity effect. Specifically, the  CS model appears to more closely mimic the gene expression changes seen in real spaceflight, particularly in  terms of immune and endocrine-related pathways. This suggests that the 3D clinostat might be a more accurate  and reliable model for studying the effects of microgravity on the central nervous system. The CS and FL models  demonstrated a convergent alteration in three KEGG signaling pathways: GnRH signaling pathway, Neuroactive  ligand-receptor interaction, and Ovarian steroidogenesis, as well as eight common differential genes, including  Ibsp, Adam3, Xlr3b, G530011O06Rik, Wdr62, Cd22, Gm4675, and Nusap1. The GnRH signaling pathway plays  a pivotal role in the hypothalamus, regulating the function of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG)  axis. Under microgravity conditions, significant changes occur in the endocrine system, which may impact the  release of GnRH and the activity of the signaling pathway. This alteration in the GnRH signaling pathway may  subsequently lead to fluctuations in sex hormone levels and participate in the regulation of cognition, emotion,  and behavior37. The Neuroactive Ligand-Receptor Interaction pathway encompasses the intricate interplay  between numerous neurotransmitters and hormones (such as dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and  others) and their respective receptors. This interaction is vital for neural transmission, emotional regulation,  cognitive functions, and neural plasticity. Microgravity and spaceflight can potentially induce alterations in  neural adaptability, as well as changes in the levels and sensitivity of neurotransmitters, which may be linked  to the Neuroactive Ligand-Receptor Interaction38. The Ovarian Steroidogenesis signaling pathway is concerned  with the production of estrogen and progesterone. Although ovarian steroidogenesis primarily occurs within  the reproductive system, it also exerts significant influence on the brain, particularly in regulating emotions,  cognition, and neural plasticity39. Furthermore, estrogen possesses neuroprotective properties, contributing  to the maintenance of neuronal health and function40. Under microgravity conditions, a decrease in estrogen  levels may diminish its neuroprotective effects, potentially increasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases or  cognitive decline. The greater similarity in gene expression profiles between the CS and FL models supports the  use of this method as a representative model for spaceflight-induced neurobiological changes. The lack of overlap in differentially expressed genes between the HU and FL models further underscores  the limitations of the HU model in replicating the effects of actual spaceflight. While the HU model has been  widely used to simulate microgravity effect, particularly for studying muscle atrophy and bone loss, it appears  to fall short in accurately modeling the complex changes in brain function induced by real spaceflight41,42.  This discrepancy may be due to the localized nature of the HU model, which primarily affects the hindlimbs  and may not adequately capture the whole-body effects of microgravity. In contrast, the 3D clinostat model  provides a more holistic simulation of microgravity effect, potentially leading to more relevant insights into  how spaceflight affects the brain. The HU model demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to alterations in cerebral  blood flow, rendering it an appropriate choice for investigating notable cognitive shifts following return from  spaceflight, while the 3D clinostat model is more likely to focus on subtle cognitive changes caused by adaptation  to microgravity in space, which may be related to vestibular function and spatial orientation. The metabolomic analysis of serum samples provided additional insights into the systemic effects of 3D  clinostat model. The observed alterations in various metabolic pathways, including ABC transporters, Sphingolipid  signaling, and the Pentose phosphate pathway, suggest that microgravity effect disrupts lipid metabolism, energy  production, and cellular signaling processes. The downregulation of key metabolites such as L-Lysine, oleic  acid, and niacinamide points to potential deficiencies in essential nutrients, which could exacerbate the stress  response and impair overall health. L-Lysine is an essential amino acid involved in protein synthesis, while oleic  acid is a major component of membrane phospholipids and has anti-inflammatory properties43. Niacinamide,  a form of vitamin B3, is crucial for energy production and DNA repair44,45. The reduction in these metabolites  suggests that microgravity might lead to nutritional imbalances that could have far-reaching effects on health. The microbiome analysis further supports these findings, showing significant alterations in gut microbiota  composition, particularly the reduction in Bacteroides  and Turicibacter . The reduction in Bacteroides  is consistent  with the reported elevation of the Firmicutes /Bacteroidetes  ratio in the intestinal flora of astronauts during  spaceflights25. The gut microbiota plays a critical role in regulating immune function, metabolism, and overall  health, and its disruption could have serious consequences during spaceflight. Previous studies have shown that  changes in the gut microbiota can lead to a range of health issues, including immune dysregulation, metabolic  Scientific Reports  |         (2025) 15:5731 12 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-90212-ywww.nature.com/scientificreports/ disorders, and even mental health problems45. The observed changes in the gut microbiota in this study suggest  that simulated microgravity effect may lead to similar health challenges, emphasizing the need for strategies  to maintain gut health during long-term space missions. The functional analysis of the microbial community  revealed significant differences in KEGG signaling pathways between the CS and SB groups. Pathways such as  Ferroptosis, PPAR signaling, and Glycosaminoglycan degradation were notably affected, indicating potential  alterations in cellular death processes, lipid metabolism, and extracellular matrix remodeling. These changes  could have implications for tissue integrity and function, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, which is highly  sensitive to environmental stressors46. The disruption of these pathways could contribute to the gastrointestinal  problems of astronauts, such as increased gut permeability, altered bowel habits and increased susceptibility  to infections47. The alterations in gut microbiota composition observed in this study also suggest that dietary  interventions or probiotics could be explored as potential strategies to maintain gut health during space missions. The findings of this study have significant implications for understanding the health risks associated with  long-term spaceflight. The 3D clinostat model offers a practical and cost-effective method for simulating  microgravity effect on Earth, allowing for the systematic study of its effects on various physiological systems.  The results suggest that microgravity may have a more pronounced impact on emotional and motivational states  than on cognitive functions, highlighting the need for further research into the psychological well-being of  astronauts during extended missions. While our study provided important insights into the 3D clinostat simulated microgravity effect, it is essential  to acknowledge certain limitations. Firstly, although some behavioral changes were observed, many of them  did not reach statistical significance, potentially due to the relatively small sample size in the study, leading to  the possibility that subtle behavioral changes might have been overlooked. Secondly, in space environments,  males and females exhibit gender-specific differences in the responses of various bodily systems. This study  exclusively used male mice; however, considering the impact of gender factors, it is a scientifically valuable  question worth further investigation to determine whether female mice exhibit different responses to the 3D  clinostat. Furthermore, we noted significant differences in multiple behavioral indicators, as well as in the  transcriptome and metabolome, between mice in the survival box control (SB) group compared to ordinary  cage control (MC) group, highlighting the crucial impact of social isolation and spatial confinement on the  organism. Further analysis of the synergistic effects of microgravity, social isolation, and spatial constraints is  a scientific issue worthy of further attention in the next step. Moreover, it is important to acknowledge that  variability in transcriptome data may be influenced by differences in time points, exposure durations, and  collection methodologies employed across clinostat studies, hindlimb unloading experiments, and spaceflight  missions. Additionally, although mice spend most of their time inactive in the resting chamber of the survival  box, they may still be forced to move or perform actions against gravity-direction changes. It is acknowledged  that the 3D clinostat and hindlimb unloading models do not truly simulate microgravity in a strict physical  sense. The 3D clinostat creates a condition where the gravity orientation continuously changes, and the hindlimb  unloading model provides mechanical unloading. However, our study focuses on the biological effects that  resemble those under microgravity conditions. The data from the 3D clinostat—treated mice show changes  in behavior, metabolism, microbiome, and brain transcriptome. Although these changes may be due to the  mice’s response to altered gravity orientation rather than actual microgravity, they share similarities with the  biological effects observed in spaceflight studies. For instance, the changes in the vestibular system, as indicated  by gait analysis, are consistent with the vestibular dysfunctions reported by astronauts during space missions.  Similarly, the alterations in immune and endocrine—related signaling pathways in the brain transcriptome are  also in line with previous spaceflight—related research. These similarities suggest that the 3D clinostat model  can serve as a valuable tool for studying the potential biological consequences of microgravity on Earth. It is  important to acknowledge the differences in physical principles between our models and actual spaceflight,  and when selecting models, one must be mindful of these differences to ensure that the appropriate animal  model is chosen according to the research objectives. Nevertheless, due to the limitations and difficulties of  simulating microgravity on Earth, the 3D clinostat mouse model for simulating microgravity is a powerful  supplement to the limited ground-based models currently available. The 3D clinostat model provided a more  similar simulation of brain gene expression alterations than hindlimb unloading, yet future research is essential  to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the observed behavioral and neurobiological changes, particularly  through targeted studies on specific brain regions and molecular pathways. For example, studying the effects of  microgravity effect on the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex could provide deeper insights into how  microgravity impacts cognitive function and emotional regulation. Additionally, exploring potential therapeutic  interventions could provide valuable insights into mitigating the adverse effects of microgravity on astronaut  health. Pharmacological treatments that target specific pathways affected by microgravity, such as immune or  endocrine signaling, could also help maintain health during long-term space missions. Conclusion In summary, our research underscored that 3D clinostat model exerted profound effects on the behavior,  metabolism, microbiome, and brain transcriptome. Compared to hindlimb unloading model, the 3D clinostat  model demonstrates a closer resemblance to the brain transcriptome expression profiles observed in spaceflight  animals, thereby offering a novel and invaluable research tool for simulating microgravity effect on Earth.

The impact of 3D clinostat on cognitive and motor related behavior We conducted a series of behavioral experiments to observe the 3D clinostat simulated microgravity effect on cognitive and motor related behaviors in mice. The results indicated that there were no statistically significant differences among the three groups of mice in terms of the duration of immobility in both the forced swim test and tail suspension test, as well as the percentage of open arm entries in the elevated plus maze. One of the key findings of this study is the differential gene expression pattern observed in the CS model compared to the HU and FL models. o r g / s e Scientific Reports | (2025) 15:5731 13 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-90212-ywww.nature.com/scientificreports/ a r c h / p r o j e c t / C N P 0 0 0 6 4 4 8 ) . 1 0 0 7 / s 0 0 2 2 1 - 0 1 7 - 5 0 5 6 - 7 (2017).

Mason5,6,7,8, Kasthuri Venkateswaran3†   and Afshin Beheshti9,10†    Abstract  Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has a detrimental impact on human health on Earth and it is equally  concerning in other environments such as space habitat due to microgravity, radiation and confinement, especially  for long‑ distance space travel. The International Space Station (ISS) is ideal for investigating microbial diversity and  virulence associated with spaceflight. The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial  Tracking–1 (MT ‑1) project and resulting metagenome ‑assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight  different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR  genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs  retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes). Results: We have analyzed the data using a deep learning model, allowing us to go beyond traditional cut ‑offs  based only on high DNA sequence similarity and extending the catalog of AMR genes. Our results in PMA treated  samples revealed AMR dominance in the last flight for Kalamiella piersonii, a bacteria related to urinary tract infection  in humans. The analysis of 226 pure strains isolated from the MT ‑1 project revealed hundreds of antibiotic resistance  genes from many isolates, including two top ‑ranking species that corresponded to strains of Enterobacter bugandensis  and Bacillus cereus. Computational predictions were experimentally validated by antibiotic resistance profiles in these  two species, showing a high degree of concordance. Specifically, disc assay data confirmed the high resistance of  these two pathogens to various beta‑lactam antibiotics. Conclusion: Overall, our computational predictions and validation analyses demonstrate the advantages of machine  learning to uncover concealed AMR determinants in metagenomics datasets, expanding the understanding of the ISS  environmental microbiomes and their pathogenic potential in humans.

Accordingly, with NASA setting the course  to return to the Moon with the Artemis mission and  eventually venture out to Mars, maintaining the health  of astronauts during long-term spaceflight is of para - mount importance [1 ]. One area of particular concern  is the reported increase in virulence and antibiotic  resistance of microorganisms in space experiments [4 ,  30, 36, 49, 51, 56, 61]. Combined with a depressed or  altered immune response in astronauts [25, 46], there  is an increased risk of opportunistic microbial infec - tion. Spaceflight promotes biofilm formation [32], and  bacteria cultured from astronauts during flight were  more resistant than isolates obtained from the same  individual either pre- or post-flight [50]. Mutations also  occurred more frequently in long-term spaceflights  [24]. An alternative non-mutually exclusive hypothesis  to increased virulence or microbial resistance to anti - biotics is that spaceflight conditions might alter the  stability of pharmaceuticals [23]. In any case, bacterial  infections might be more challenging to treat in space. The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed-built  environment with its own environmental microbiome  shaped by microgravity, radiation, and limited human  presence [53]. We and others have shown that microbi - omes are dynamic, diverse and sometimes intertwined  at the ISS. Be et al. [8] analyzed antibiotic resistance and  virulence genes from dust and vacuum filter samples of  ISS (treated with propidium monoazide, or PMA), dem - onstrating that human skin-associated microbes impact  the ISS microbiome. Indeed, the skin and intestinal  microbiomes of astronauts that spent 6 to 12 months in  the ISS have been shown to be altered [55]. In addition,  the salivary microbiome of astronauts changed as a result  of spaceflight, potentially activating microbes that pro - mote viral replication [52] and altering the abundance of  some antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes [35]. The ISS  itself also presents specific core microbiome signatures  on its surfaces that we characterized recently using shot - gun metagenome and amplicon sequencing [14, 43, 51],  analogous to microbiome signatures found in specific  geographies on Earth [18]. Further analyses across several missions have revealed  that the microbiome of the crew’s skin resembled those of  the surfaces inside the ISS collected by the crewmember  on the same flight [5]. To better understand the compo - sition of these bacterial populations we and others have  characterized shotgun whole-genome sequencing (WGS)  of several ISS microorganisms [10, 11, 45]. Although  most of them have been found to be non-pathogenic to  humans, there are exceptions such as antibiotic-resist - ant Enterobacter bugandensis strains that could have an  increased chance of pathogenicity [44].Computational analyses of microbiome data collected  in Earth have shown that AMR can be predicted from  genomic sequence of pure cultures alone [29, 47], but a  consensus approach on the best way to detect AMRs  in metagenomic datasets has yet to be established [41].  Generally, predictions are restricted to high identity  (high sequence similarity to databases) cut-offs, requir - ing a ‘best-hit’ on an appropriate AMR database with a  sequence identity greater than 80% by many programs  such as ResFinder [60]. Although the ‘best-hit’ approach  has a low false-positive rate, the false-negative rate can  be very high, and a large number of actual Antibiotic  Resistance Genes (ARGs) are predicted as non-ARGs,  thus concealing the identification of potentially func - tional ARGs [3]. Another method of identification is to  link the immune repertoire of the astronaut to the pep - tides of the microbes on the ISS, but this requires com - plex coordination with crew sampling and is rare [19].  However, it has been shown recently that deep learn - ing, a class of machine learning algorithms, can expand  the catalog of AMR genes and increase the accuracy  of the predictions based on metagenomic data [3, 13,  27]. We then hypothesized that the characterization of  AMR from sequencing data at the ISS could be investi - gated from an artificial intelligence perspective using a  robust deep learning framework. For that, we analyzed  whole-genome sequences of 226 pure strains (cultivable  microbes), metagenome sequences of 21 environmental  samples, and 24 MAGs retrieved from PMA treated sam - ples (Fig.  1) using the supervised deep learning approach  proposed by Arango-Argoty et al. [3], which has shown  high sensitivity for detection of AMR genes in an inde - pendent benchmark [57]. Results Predictions based on short metagenomics sequences  and ORFs partly overlap with previous analyses and reveal  new AMR determinants at the ISS surface microbiome The first shotgun metagenome sequencing of intact  microbial cells (Propidium monoazide-PMA treated)  without whole-genome amplification was performed by  Singh et al. [43]. There, samples were taken in 8 locations  across three flights (F1, F2, F3) during a period of 12  months. A detailed description of sampling procedures  and locations, species diversity and functional charac - terization can be found in Singh et al. [43]. To deploy a  deep learning approach for predicting antibiotic resist - ance genes from metagenomic data, we used DeepARG,  a computational resource proven to be more accurate  than traditional approaches [3]. We first run DeepARG- SS (DeepARG for short reads) using the recommended  prediction probability cut-off of 0.8 to obtain read  counts of AMR genes (Fig.  2a). As in the seminal paper  Page 3 of 12  Madrigal et al. Microbiome          (2022) 10:134    [43], quantification of antibiotics associated with AMR  revealed ‘beta lactams’ ranking first and ‘peptide’ sec - ond, and generally more AMR reads counts observed in  Flight 3 (F3) than in previous two flights (Fig.  2a). How - ever, reads counts in certain antibiotics such as pleuro - mutilin, mupirocin and rifamycin were found largely in  Flight 2 (Fig.  2a). Our read counts correlate (r = 0.86,  p = 6.879e−7; Pearson’s product-moment correlation)  with read counts obtained for antimicrobial resistance by  Singh et al. [43] (Fig.  2b). Taken together, these suggest a  partial overlap with results obtained in Singh et  al. [43]  analyzed using the traditional approach. While more AMR reads counts were found in Flight  3, we also observed variability between the different  locations and flights, and an increasing number of read  counts associated with time. For instance, location 4  (L4, surface of the dining table) increased the number  of AMR reads counts with successive flights (Fig.  2b, c).  While resistance to ‘beta lactams’ was evenly distributed  across flights and locations, resistance to ‘polymyxin’ and  especially ‘peptide’ represents a more significant pro - portion of AMR counts in locations of Flight 3 (Fig.  2c).  In addition, we also observed the widespread presence  of reads related to Macrolides, Lincosamides, Strepto - gamines (MLS), and tetracycline resistance. To investigate the possible association between AMR  patterns and specific microbes, we assembled the short  reads into Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs;  see Methods), identified their Open Reading Frames (ORFs), and repeated the prediction of ARGs using  DeepARG-LS [3]. Figure  3a shows the distribution of  DeepARG classification probabilities and best-hit iden - tity of ARGs in MAGs from the ISS. As we can retrieve  highly probable ARGs (probability > 0.8) presenting low  sequence identity (for many ARGs, identity is < 40%), this  method is likely more advantageous than using the ‘best- hit’ approach only. Compared to DeepARG-SS results  obtained previously, the analysis of MAGs did not reveal  significant differences in the number of ARGs predicted  in the ORFs for the different flights (Fig.  3b). However,  interestingly the results show a smaller number bacterial  species having ARGs in Flight #1 (F1) when compared  to Flights #2 and #3 (Fig.  3b, c) (data is shown for MAGs  with at least 1 predicted ARG; the total number of MAGs  analyzed is 24). Specifically, the number of locations is  smaller in Flight 1 (n = 3) than in F2 (n = 6) and F3 (n  = 7) (Fig.  3b). Many ARGs were identified in Kalamiella  piersonii MAGs in multiple locations during F3, show - ing AMR patterns related to (glyco)peptide, fluoroqui - nolone and MLS (Fig.  3c). Of note, the K. piersonii strain  closely related to one found at the ISS has been associ - ated to human urinary tract infection [40]. The poten - tially very pathogenic microbe E. bugandensis was found  in location 2 (forward side panel wall of the Waste and  Hygiene Compartment) in Flight 1, presenting more than  40 ARGs. In addition, in the original study, Pantoea spe - cies were found to be the dominant genus in samples in  5 out of 7 locations sampled from Flight 3, especially at  Fig. 1 Overview of sample collection and data analysis for the characterization of antibiotic resistance at the ISS using deep learning. The data are  processed in a step ‑wise fashion including data QC, mapping, quantification, and matching to time of collection and mission.

Microbiome          (2022) 10:134  Specifically, the re-analysis of short sequences and  MAGs from the ISS reveals dominance of K. piersonii   antibiotic resistance in different locations of Flight 3  (Fig. 3 c). Distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in scaffolds  of Microbial Tracking‑1 strains isolated from the ISS We then applied DeepARG-LS to 226 Microbial Track - ing-1 (MT-1) isolates (Mason and Venkateswaran labs,  published and unpublished WGS of MT-1 pure strains  isolated from ISS environment). We found a range of 2 to  92 ARGs in 184 out of 226 isolates (Fig.  4a; Table  S1). This  machine learning approach allowed us to go beyond the  traditional cut-off based only on high sequence DNA simi - larity (Figure  S1). These results suggest a widespread pres - ence of potential ARGs in the isolates, with ‘multi-drug’  class being first, followed by glycopeptides, beta-lactams,  bacitracin, and tetracyclines. The ‘multi-drug’ antibiotic  class was defined by aggregating several antibiotic names  from the CARD and ARDB databases (efflux, multi-drug  and na_antimicrobials). We then used BLAST to match  isolates showing AMR sequences predicted by Deep - ARG to microbial species (Fig.  4a) and identified Bacillus  cereus and E. bugandensis, which were previously profiled  organisms on the ISS [44, 54] as the top 2 ranking species  with a high number of ARGs. We have previously shown  that five E. bugandensis isolates were almost equivalent to  nosocomial earth isolates showing resistance to multi-drug  antibiotic compounds, fluoroquinolones, and fosfomycin  [44]. In addition, E. bugandensis strains were shown to  be resistant to 9 antibiotics [51]. Our results reinforce the  potential pathogenicity of this microbe. Nonetheless, anti - microbial resistance was not examined for B. cereus strains  in Venkateswaran et al. [54]. B. cereus is a food poisoning  microorganism that might be a concern for crew mem - bers’ health. In addition, we found novel ARGs associated  with other species such as K. pneumoniae, Pantoea, Pae- nibacillus polymyxa, Bacillus velezensis, Enterococcus fae - calis , Sphingomonas, and, with a lower number of ARGs,  several species of Staphylococcus. E. faecalis virulence was  previously shown to be affected by microgravity [28]. We  then used the tool Prokka [42] to fully annotate the bacte - rial isolates, finding as expected that the number of coding  sequences, but not the number of ARGs, increased in pro - portion to genome sizes (Figure  S2a). Then, we ran the pan- genome analysis tool Roary [38] to compare isolates of E. bugandensis (10) and B. cereus (10) finding that the core set  of genes was highly conserved among strains of the same  species (Figure S2b). To experimentally validate machine learning predic - tions on previously unobserved AMR patterns above,  we performed Antibacterial Susceptibility Tests (AST)  for the species found to be potentially most pathogenic,  in our case E. bugandensis and B. cereus as they have a  higher number of ARGs (Table  S1; Fig.  4a). For that, we  use disc diffusion on strains isolated at the ISS for the fol - lowing antimicrobials: Cefazolin (beta− lactam), Cefoxitin  (beta−lactam), Ciprofloxacin (quinolone), Erythromycin  (MLS), Gentamycin (aminoglycoside), Oxacillin (beta− lac- tam), Penicillin (beta− lactam), Rifampin (rifamycin), and  Tobramycin (aminoglycoside) (Fig.  4b). The prediction pat - terns closely matched the AST results (Fig.  4b), although  DeepARG failed to detect Rifampin resistance, especially  for E. bugandensis. Although different antibiotics have different inhibitory  zone cut-offs for a strain to be considered as resistant  (Table  S2), remarkably we found an inverse correlation  between the zone of inhibition and ARG count for B.  cereus (r = − 0.637, Pearson’s product-moment correla - tion, p = 2.2e−7) and E. bugandensis (r = − 0.517; p =  0.0002765) (Fig.  4c), demonstrating the applicability and  high accuracy of computational prediction of AMR for  microbiome data obtained in space. Discussion Many ARGs that present high probability but low  sequence identity to known sequences will be missed  using traditional ‘best-hit’ approaches that require a  high degree of sequence identity. To solve this, compu - tational methods have been developed to identify AMR  in genomes and metagenomes [3, 9, 16, 33, 41]. Despite  these developments, a consensus approach to detect  AMR in metagenomics datasets is yet to be defined [41].  The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes  associated with cultivated strains and metagenomes  generated from the ISS environmental surfaces using an  accurate deep learning approach (Fig. 1). Firstly, we re-analyzed shotgun metagenome sequences  of 21 environmental samples that were treated with  PMA (viable microbes), and their associated 24 MAGs  retrieved from the PMA-treated samples. The re-analysis  showed increased read counts associated with AMR and  Fig. 4 Heatmap and clustering of ARG counts detected in MT ‑1 pure strains isolated from the ISS and AST validations. a Heatmap with ARG count.

Page 8 of 12 Madrigal et al. Microbiome          (2022) 10:134  in more locations for flight 3 when considering MAGs  (Fig.  2). This could be explained due to the ISS crew being  replaced during Flight 3. The abundance of Enterobac - teriaceae in Flight 3 was discussed in Singh et  al. [43].  We have not observed any differences between early vs.  late ISS microbiome cultures. For example, Enterobacter  bugandansis  strains were isolated from F2 and F3 sample  sets, but the genome comparison and phenotype analy - ses revealed limited change, with a maximum of 15 SNPs  among ISS isolates [44]. In addition, K. piersonii spread  across four different locations (L1, L5, L7, L8) at Flight  3, presenting resistance to specific antibiotics (glyco/ peptide, fluoroquinolone and MLS) (Fig.  3c). We have  previously isolated strains from Locations 1, 2, 5, 6, and  7, defining a novel bacterial genus from the ISS samples  [45]. While K. piersonii do have virulence genes in the  genome, a dichotomy was found as disc diffusion tests  revealed multi-drug resistance, while the PathogenFinder  algorithm predicted K. piersonii strains as non-human  pathogens. All seven K. piersonii isolates were resistant to  cefoxitin (beta_lactam class in DeepARG), erythromycin  (MLS), oxacillin (beta_lactam), penicillin (beta_lactam),  and rifampin. At the same time, all strains were suscepti - ble to cefazolin, ciprofloxacin (quinolone), and tobramy - cin (aminoglycoside) [45]. The DeepARG database does  not include some of these antibiotics, but we found AMR  sequences related to resistance to (glyco)peptide, fluoro - quinolone, and MLS, validating some previous results.  Therefore, PathogenFinder [17] results in Singh et al. [45]  suggesting K. piersonii as a non-human pathogen should  be treated with caution. Furthermore, the strain YU22  (closest match is IIIF1SW-P2T detected as ISS) isolated  in urine microbiome of a kidney stone patient has shown  to be an uropathogenic bacteria, showing many virulence  factors that are needed for host cell invasion and coloni - zation [40]. Secondly, the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of 226  pure strains (cultivable microbes) were analyzed to iden - tify AMR genes (Fig.  4a). We found the human pathogens  E. bugandensis and B. cereus presenting many potential  ARGs in the MT-1 scaffolds. Up to five strains isolated  from the ISS have been closely related to the type strain  EB-247T and two clinical isolates (153_ECLO and MBRL  1077) and share similar AMR patterns [44]. One hundred  twelve genes were found to be involved in virulence, dis - ease, and defence in the ISS strains [44]. Our re-analysis  confirms the multi-drug resistance (MDR) to antibiotics  for the ISS isolates, which is the highest among all the iso - lates. Our previous research uncovered the presence of  genes associated with MDR efflux pump [44], belonging  to RND (resistance, nodulation and cell division) protein  family, which are reported to be the major contributors  of resistance to antibiotic and other toxic compounds to the bacteria [20]. MDR has been reported to play role in  the physiological function and confer resistance to sub - stances like host defense molecule and bile, which can  lead to pathogenicity in humans [48]. Unlike in Singh  et al. [43], we found fluoroquinolone resistance low, and  null for fosfomycin. Conversely, B. cereus is a gram-pos - itive bacterium commonly found in food. After infec - tion, most emetic patients recover within 24 hours, but in  some cases, the toxin can be fatal via a fulminant hepatic  failure [22, 34]. Overall, multi-drug resistance was found  widespread in many microbes. Third, phenotypic antibiotic resistance testing data  obtained from traditional antibiotic tests generated for  biosafety level 2 strains were compared with the com - putational approaches that predicted the presence of  the AMR genes, showing an excellent agreement for the  antibiotics tested (Fig.  4b, c). A disadvantage of the deep  learning model developed by Arango-Argoty et al. [3] is  that the prediction can disentangle the family of antibiot - ics but not specific compounds. Many studies have shown the association between  several microorganisms (bacterial, as well as phage and  non-phase viral sequences) and several cancer features.  Although it is unclear whether this corresponds to corre - lation or causation, the microbiome can undoubtedly be  used as a cancer biomarker. For instance, certain strains  of Fusobacterium  sp. can be utilized as an independent  diagnostic assay for colon cancer [62]. Therefore, a better  understanding of the microbial communities and their  degree of pathogenicity in surface-human microbiomes  in space could also be useful for human health monitori - zation with detection and prognostic values in long term  space travel. Rather than the gather-and-return sampling  model currently used for the ISS, new developments in  sequencing technologies in combination with Artificial  Intelligence will allow for efficient analysis onboard the  ISS and in long-duration space missions. We are currently collecting more data for Micro - bial Tracking-2 (MT-2) and MT-3 missions. We plan to  extend the AMR catalog, characterize microbial diversity,  and monitor the evolution of AMR in longer time peri - ods to discover new factors involved in pathogenicity of  microorganisms exposed to space conditions. Methods Metagenome‑Assembled Genomes (MAGs) methodology The paired-end 100-bp metagenomic reads from NCBI  Short Read Archive (SRA) under the bio-project number  PRJNA438545 were processed with Trimmomatic [12]  to trim adapter sequences and low-quality ends, with a  minimum Phred score of 20 across the entire length of  the read used as a quality cut-off. Reads shorter than 80  bp were removed after trimming. Remaining high-quality  Page 9 of 12  Madrigal et al. Microbiome          (2022) 10:134    reads were subsequently assembled using metaSPAdes  [37]. Contigs were binned using Metabat2 v2.11.3 [31].  Recovered genomes were evaluated with CheckM [39],  and a recovered genome was considered good with at  least 90% completeness and at most 10% contamina - tion. Each genome was subsequently annotated with the  help of Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology  (RAST), and near identifications were predicted [6]. Sample collection for Microbial Tracking 1 mission During the microbial tracking investigation to character - ize airborne and surface-associated microbial population  aboard the International Space Station, samples were col - lected from ISS locations, and ground samples were col - lected from the Crew resupply vehicle. A sterile polyester  wipe premoistened with Phosphate buffered saline (PBS)  was used to collect the samples from various areas across  these ISS locations, and the details and description of  the sample collection and cultivation have already been  reported in Checinska Sielaff et al. [14] and Singh et al.  [43]. Pure isolates were selected and sub-cultured, and  the sub-cultures were sequenced. Isolates from Microbial Tracking 1 mission To create the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of these  strains, shotgun libraries were prepared using the Illu - mina Nextera Flex protocol [44], using NovaSeq 6000  S4 flow cell 2150 paired-end (PE) sequencing. Verifica - tion of the quality of the raw sequencing data was carried  out using FastQC v0.11.7 [2]. Quality control for adapter  trimming and quality filtering were performed using fastp  v0.20.0 [15], and then SPAdes v3.11.1 [7] was used to  assemble all the cleaned sequences. Fastp quality control  was based on the following three parameters: (i) correc - tion of mismatches in overlapped regions of paired-end  reads, (ii) trimming of autodetected adapter sequences,  and (iii) quality trimming at the 59 and 39 ends. To deter - mine the quality of the assembled sequences, the num - ber of contigs, the N50 value, and the total length were  calculated using QUAST v5.0.2 [26]. Default parameters  were used for all software. The average nucleotide iden - tity (ANI) [59] was calculated using OrthoANIu by com - paring each of the scaffolds to the WGS of the respective  type strains. Identification of ORFs in microbial DNA sequences Glimmer (Gene Locator and Interpolated Markov Mod - elER) v3.02 was used with default parameters to identify  the coding regions and distinguish them from non- coding DNA in MAGs and MT-1 scaffolds that could  be used as an input in DeepARG-LS. Minimum gene  length was indicated as 50 bp (‘glimmer3 -g50’). Glim - mer reads DNA sequences in a FASTA file format and predicts genes in them using an Interpolated Context  Model [21]. Prediction of antibiotic resistance genes in short reads  and full‑gene length sequences DeepARG version 2 [3 ], a deep learning-based approach  for predicting ARGs and annotation, was run with  the ‘--reads’ option (DeepARG-SS) for NGS reads and  the ‘--genes’ option (DeepRG-LS) for longer gene-like  sequences obtained with Glimmer. The DeepARG model  consists of four dense hidden layers of 2000, 1000, 500,  and 100 units that propagate a bit score distribution. The  output layer of the deep neural network consists of 30  units that correspond to the antibiotic resistance catego - ries (102 antibiotics consolidated into 30 antibiotic cat - egories). The model was trained with a curated database  of 14,933 genes from three databases (CARD, ARDB, and  UNIPROT) [ 3]. Default options were used: 50% minimum  percentage of identity to consider, significance of the pre - diction probability cut-off of 0.8 as recommended [3 ],  and E-value of alignments (default 1e− 10). The software  was downloaded from https:// bitbu cket. org/ gusph dproj/   deepa rg-  ss. Microbial nucleotide BLAST Nucleotide-Nucleotide BLAST 2.10.1+ (https:// blast.  ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ Blast. cgi) was used to identify micro - bial species associated to MT-1 scaffolds. Sequences  producing significant alignments were ranked and the  species associated to maximum Score (bits) and mini - mum E value was deemed as the closest match. Gene annotations and pan‑genome analysis of MT‑1  scaffolds A Docker image with the software tool Prokka v1.14.5  [42] was pulled and used with default parameters to  annotate bacterial isolates. The master annotations in  GFF3 format for the 226 isolates have been deposited at  the Zenodo platform [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6518836].  Using the annotated assemblies in GFF3 format for E.  bugandensis and B. cereus strains, Roary v3.13.0 was run  with default parameters to compare isolates based on  genes and the number of isolates they are present in. Phenotypic antibiotic resistance testing Disc assays experiments were performed and reported  in Urbaniak et  al. [51]. The isolates were streaked from  glycerol stocks onto R2A plates. A single colony was  inoculated into 5 mL Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) and grown  overnight at 30°C. Aliquots of 100 μL were plated on  TSA. Agar diffusion discs (BD BBLTM Sensi-DiscTM,  Franklin Lakes, NJ) were placed aseptically on a plate and  the strains were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The tested  Page 10 of 12 Madrigal et al. Microbiome          (2022) 10:134  antibiotics included: 30-μg cefazolin (CZ-30); 30-μg  cefoxitin (FOX-30), 5 μg ciprofloxacin (CIP-5), 15 μg  erythromycin (E-15), 10-μg gentamicin (GM-10), 1-μg  oxacillin (OX), 10-μg penicillin (P-10), 5-μg rifampin  (RA-5), and 10 μg tobramycin (NN-10). The diameter of  inhibition zones was measured for each antibiotic disk  and recorded in millimeters. The resistance results were  compared with the zone diameter interpretive charts  provided by the manufacturer. When the spontaneous  mutants were present in response to some antibiotics,  they were isolated, subcultured and tested for the specific  antibiotic resistance. Data availability Raw metagenomics reads from three flights on multi - ple locations were downloaded from NASA GeneLab  repository https:// genel  ab. nasa. gov (GLDS-69). The  ISS MAGs datasets are available at the SRA database  under the accession number: PRJNA438545 [https://   www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ biopr  oject/ PRJNA 438545/].  Microbial tracking-1 (MT-1) datasets (raw sequencing  data and sequence assembly files) were obtained from  GLDS-67, GLDS-302, GLDS-303, GLDS-309, GLDS- 311 and GLDS-350. The rest of the samples are depos - ited at DDBJ/ ENA/GenBank or are unpublished.

Although most of them have been found to be non-pathogenic to humans, there are exceptions such as antibiotic-resist - ant Enterobacter bugandensis strains that could have an increased chance of pathogenicity [44].Computational analyses of microbiome data collected in Earth have shown that AMR can be predicted from genomic sequence of pure cultures alone [29, 47], but a consensus approach on the best way to detect AMRs in metagenomic datasets has yet to be established [41]. Compared to DeepARG-SS results obtained previously, the analysis of MAGs did not reveal significant differences in the number of ARGs predicted in the ORFs for the different flights (Fig. 1 Overview of sample collection and data analysis for the characterization of antibiotic resistance at the ISS using deep learning. The black arrows indicate Kalamiella piersonii Page 6 of 12 Madrigal et al. Microbiome (2022) 10:134 Specifically, the re-analysis of short sequences and MAGs from the ISS reveals dominance of K. piersonii antibiotic resistance in different locations of Flight 3 (Fig. Distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in scaffolds of Microbial Tracking‑1 strains isolated from the ISS We then applied DeepARG-LS to 226 Microbial Track - ing-1 (MT-1) isolates (Mason and Venkateswaran labs, published and unpublished WGS of MT-1 pure strains isolated from ISS environment). The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with cultivated strains and metagenomes generated from the ISS environmental surfaces using an accurate deep learning approach (Fig. Page 7 of 12 Madrigal et al.

The NASA GeneLab project has detailed information on radiation exposure using animal models with curated dosimetry information for spaceﬂight experiments. Methods: We analyzed multiple GeneLab omics datasets associated with both ground-based and spaceﬂight radiation studies that included in vivo and in vitro approaches. A range of ions from protons to iron particles with doses from 0.1 to 1.0 Gy for ground studies, as well as samples ﬂown in low Earth orbit (LEO) with total doses of 1.0 mGy to 30 mGy, were utilized. Results: From this analysis, we were able to identify distinct biological signatures associating speciﬁc ions with speciﬁc biological responses due to radiation exposure in space. For example, we discovered changes in mitochondrial function, ribosomal assembly, and immune pathways as a function of dose. Conclusions: We provided a summary of how the GeneLab’s rich database of omics experiments with animal models can be used to generate novel hypotheses to better understand human health risks from GCR exposures.

Introduction Space is a hostile environment, and human space travel will entail e ects at many levels of biological organization leading to related physiological e ects. One of the major environmental factors Cancers 2020 ,12, 381; doi:10.3390 /cancers12020381 www.mdpi.com /journal /cancers Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 2 of 23 in space is radiation. Ionizing radiation in space is composed of a complex mixture of particles including protons from the sun and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) originating from outside the solar system. The GCR is composed of atomic nuclei, including a component of heavy charged and energetic (HZE) particles that are relatively few in number but highly ionizing. A major risk-factor for human spaceﬂight is exposure GCR HZE that can cause DNA damage that is unrepaired or mis-repaired [1]. Current research has shown measurable impact on in several areas a ecting human health bone loss [ 2], skeletal muscle atrophy [ 3–5], reproductive hazards in women and men [ 6], cognitive /behavioral changes [ 7], central nervous system (CNS) decrements [ 8,9], and changes in cardiovascular physiology [ 10]. The possibility that space radiation exposure to increase cardiovascular disease risk requires additional validation similar to the ongoing observations of increased cardiac impairment observed in radiotherapy-treated cancer survivors [ 11,12]. Spaceﬂight has also been shown to have an impact on established cancer hallmarks [13], possibly increasing carcinogenic risk [14]. At the molecular level, space radiation from high energy photons and atomic nuclei can cause damage to cellular components, in particular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Damaged DNA, which is inadequately repaired, can led to mutations and chromosomal aberrations that have potential to propagate into RNA, potentially leading to cancer. Simulations using ground-based datasets representative of a combined space radiation and microgravity exposure have demonstrated that oxidative stress processes and mitochondrial dysfunctions are important contributors to biological eects from spaceﬂight. Simulated microgravity studies have demonstrated an inhibitory e ect on cell cycle and cell proliferation [ 15]. These studies show the value of research centered on understanding the totality of space exposures [ 16]. A multitude of other biological processes that are a ected include increased genomic instability and mutation rates [ 17], immune dysregulation [ 18], and deregulated cellular energetics [ 19]. Conﬂicting results on cellular stemness [ 20] have been reported with e ects such as elongation of telomere and altered telomerase function that require clariﬁcation [21,22]. A substantial amount of work has also been generated in the area of omics. For several decades, omics animal-based studies have been performed to understand the human health risks due to spaceﬂight missions using the International Space Station, the space shuttle, biosatellites, and ground-based experiments. NASA’s growing GeneLab omics database now hosts almost 250 experimental studies on spaceﬂight exposure and analogous ground-based experiments from microbes, plants, animal models, and human /animal-derived cell cultures [ 23]. These data are available as an open-access resource for single- and multi-omic analyses on microarray, RNA-sequencing, bisulﬁte-sequencing, proteomic, metabolomic, and metagenomic datasets. Although these data are targeted to better understand the risks associated with human spaceﬂight, these experiments also demonstrate a unique stress that provides a better understanding of adverse human health e ects due to alterations in cellular behavior owing to factors such as microgravity, altered carbon dioxide levels, psychological stressors, and damaging ionizing radiation exposures from GCR and protons in the Earth’s radiation belts. These datasets, and in particular the in vivo animal models used, present a unique experimental setting to study the cellular and host-level interactions that impact human health. In this study, a meta-analysis of these accumulated transcriptomic datasets in GeneLab relevant to spaceﬂight was undertaken to uncover potential dose-dependent biological responses that will help in understanding the human health risks experienced in the spaceﬂight environment. The studies identiﬁed were from human- and animal-derived tissues or cells exposed to protons and GCR HZEs at doses ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 Gy for ground studies and using samples ﬂown to the International Space Station or shuttle missions with total doses between 1.0 and 30 mGy. Ground experiments are a well-established analog for space ﬂight, but are limited in that they are relatively high dose, high dose rate, and in most cases use single particle species, in contrast to the low dose, low dose rate mixed radiation in space. Further work is needed to elucidate platform-dependent di erences (mixed ﬁelds now being o ered at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory [ 24] are a step in this direction). The datasets were pooled and subjected to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify clusters of gene sets and associated biological processes. The results from this analysis highlight novel cellular Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 3 of 23 responses that may be relevant contributors to the combined e ects of microgravity and space radiation and therefore critical drivers of health risks from space radiation. 2. Results Using primarily in vivo animal models and their associated curated datasets available from the NASA GeneLab’s omics database, an examination of biological responses as a function of radiation dose was made using transcriptional and sequencing data. A total of 30 experimental conditions from 25 GeneLab Data System (GLDS) datasets were collected (Table 1). Multiple datasets were included from human or murine cell cultures or animal tissues from several anatomical sites (adrenal gland, blood, bone marrow, brain, breast, heart, cartilage, skin, eye, hair follicle, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, spleen, or thymus). For the simulated space radiation ground studies (GLDS-73, -80, -109, and -117) information related to energy, linear energy transfer (LET, a measure of energy deposition at the cellular and molecular scale), dose rate, particle charge, and particle mass are available and can be viewed in Table S1. The dose data for all spaceﬂight experiments, with the exception of GLDS-111, were from instruments available on the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. Analysis was completed by subject matter experts from the Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG), Johnson Space Center, NASA. The provenance of data from GLDS-111 (Bion-M1) is detailed in the environmental data section of the GLDS for Bion-M1. The doses and dose rates for ground-based exposures are from the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory with uncertainties that are less than 2% [24]. Table 1.

Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 4 of 23 2.1. Changes in RNA-Speciﬁc Error Rates Comparing Spaceﬂight Versus Ground Control Samples DNA mutations caused by ionizing radiation have been shown to propagate onto RNA during translation, unless they are adequately removed by transcription-coupled repair. Higher doses of radiation exposure to a cell will result in greater accumulated damage, up to a point where the cellular repair mechanisms are overwhelmed. However, lower levels of damage may be replicated into RNA with aberrant e ects on translation and cellular function. Thus, RNA-sequencing data using mice liver samples from two experiments were analyzed to identify potential error rates due to spaceﬂight. Analysis of the GLDS-168 dataset showed no di erence in overall mapping error rates across the entire genome (approximately 0.5%). Further investigation of the mismatches with respect to each chromosome identiﬁed error rates to be near 0.5%; however, there was no di erence between the spaceﬂight and ground control groups (Figure 1A,B). Interestingly, there were di erential error rates across some chromosomes, in particular the sex-associated chromosomes, and error rates for genes associated with mitochondrial DNA were lower than genomic DNA, supporting dynamic DNA damage repair in mitochondria (reviewed in [ 53]). Further analysis revealed increased rates of substitution in speciﬁc base sequences in GLDS-168 samples (Figure 1C) but not in the GLDS-242 dataset (Figure 1D). Speciﬁc base substitutions showed an increase in A >G and C >T substitutions in only GLDS-168 samples. We also observed a signiﬁcant increase in CGT and GTA errors but a decrease in CAC and GTG errors in spaceﬂight animals versus ground controls (all corrected p<0.05; Figure 1E). In contrast the GLDS-242 dataset showed an overall reduction, though non-signiﬁcant, in speciﬁc base errors with a signiﬁcant change in substitutions ( p<0.05, corrected) in spaceﬂight animals compared to ground controls (Figure 1D,F).

Utilizing standa rd bioinformatics  pipelines for RNA-sequencing  and microarray analyses, we obtained expression data for each dataset for use in gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [54]. The results indicated a wide variance of significantly regulated gene sets per  dataset (Figure 2). When considering a false discover y rate (FDR) < 0.05, we observed some datasets  with a low number of significantly regulated ge ne sets, whereas others had a high amount of  significant results for the three GSEA molecular signature database collections (i.e., C5, C2, and C6). Thus, for further analysis, individual gene sets were considered for analysis if they had a FDR < 0.25 in 50% or more of the total datasets examined. Then, using Cytoscape’s enrichment mapper, these  gene sets were grouped into networks and furt her examined using the auto-annotate feature to  cluster similar gene sets on the ba sis of biological similarity, referred to as “annotated gene sets”.

To compare the number of genes sets with the annotated gene sets, we provided heatmaps and clustering for all the datasets based on the NES for each molecular signature database collection for the analysis with the FDR <0.25 (Figure 4). As expected, the annotated gene sets provided fewer gene sets, enabling a more streamlined analysis downstream.

Transcriptome Evaluation of Biol ogical Functions Impacted by Spacefli ght Exposure in Animal Models    To observe the impact of radiation exposure, tr anscriptional data from experiments spanning 1  to 1000 mGy doses in animal models and cell cultures were examined for alteration in multiple biological pathways. This analysis combined statistically significant biological pathways that resulted  from GSEA analysis for each individual datase t [54]. This included the following three major  molecular signatures database collections: (1) the Gene Ontology (GO; C5) gene sets from biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functi ons; (2) the curated dataset (C2) gene sets from  chemical and genetic perturbations and canoni cal pathways such as the BioCarta, Kyoto  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Path way Interaction Database (PID), and Reactome  pathway databases; and (3) the oncogenic signatures  (C6) gene sets representing major pathways  altered in cancer.  2.3.1.

Each of these clusters was driven by an overrepresented enrichment of genes related to these pathways. In addition to understanding common biological pathways disrupted by spaceﬂight and ground-based radiation exposure, these results were also used to examine possible dose-dependent trends. Using a k-means clustering of the heatmaps representing each clustering nominal enrichment scores, six major annotated clusters were overwhelmingly represented this data, including (1) mitochondrial pathways, (2) leukocyte and adaptive immune response, (3) wound healing and VEGF pathways, (4) ribosome, (5) lipid pathways, and (6) mitotic nuclear division (Figure 5B). The nominal enrichment score (NES) for these annotated gene sets was plotted from 1mGy to 1000 mGy and ﬁtted using a generalized additive model (GAM) smoothing plot [ 55,56] (Figure 5C). Indeed, there was an observed activation as a function of dose for the mitochondrial pathway, whereas the clusters for the ribosome, lipid pathways, and mitotic nuclear division were generally inactivated.

We performed the same analysis as above but included signiﬁcant GSEA gene sets from the Gene Ontology (C5) database that had an FDR <0.05 in only three of the GeneLab datasets analyzed. Although the FDR was set at a lower threshold, the lower number of required datasets with an FDR <0.05 threshold (Figure 2) would result in more gene sets for the downstream analysis. We saw this as true when observing the number of gene sets (Figure S4). Some k-means clusters were too dense and were split into sub-clusters (Figures S5 and S6). The GAM ﬁts were provided for each cluster and sub-cluster (Figures S7–S9). As expected, this less stringent analysis approach produced less statistically signiﬁcant ﬁts with more noise confounding the data. Interestingly, some new trends appeared that can be related to space radiation-induced health risks, including decreases in muscle-related pathways as a function of increasing dose (Figure S7) and decreases in chromosome pathways with increasing dose (Figure S8). This inclusive analysis strategy demonstrated that analyzing the data in many di erent ways can reveal relevant results when that can easily be missed with only one methodology and overly strict statistical cuto s.

GSEA C2: Curated Dataset Results To expand these results, the canonical pathways (C2) molecular signatures database collection was examined in a similar manner to the gene ontology collection (C5) above. For this analysis, there were 30 total datasets as opposed to 28 for the C5 gene set analysis. We determined 411 signiﬁcantly regulated C2 gene sets using Cytoscape’s enrichment mapper with an FDR 25% in 50% of the GeneLab datasets analyzed. Due to the C2 GSEA database containing more gene sets, a larger number of gene sets and auto-annotated terms was expected. From these terms, we observed several key pathways, including mitotic and cell cycle pathways, cancer-related pathways, hypoxia-related pathways, interferon pathways, and pathways related to radiation impact on cells (Figure 6A). Cell cycle pathways [ 57], hypoxia [ 58], interferon dysregulation [ 59], and cancer [ 60–62] have all been observed in previous research studies as dysregulated due to spaceﬂight. We performed a similar analysis with C2 genes sets as we did with the C5 dose-dependent analysis (Figures 5 and 6). Using k-means clustering for heatmaps representing each clustering nominal enrichment scores, 15 major annotated clusters overwhelmingly represented these data, including (1) hypoxia, MYC, and phospholipid pathways; (2) EGF, TNF, and hematopoietic pathways; (3) E2F3, EGFR2, p53, and cell cycle pathways; (4) luminal, miR-21 targets, KRAS, and transformation pathways; (5) RB1, metastasis, mitotic division, and progenitor pathways; (6) hematopoiesis, interferons, and methylation pathways; (7) obesity-, oxidation-, and adipogenic-related pathways; (8) mitochondrial and adipogenesis pathways; (9) complex EIF binding; (10) progesterone; (11) apoptosis and phospholipid pathways; (12) inﬂammatory, invasion, NOTCH, and HNF1a pathways; (13) carcinoma, hypoxia, and IL1a pathways; (14) PKD1, ZMPSTE24, and cardiac dysfunctions; and (15) ICP with H3K27ME3 pathway (Figure 6B,C). Similar to the C5 GO analysis, we observed an increase in mitochondrial pathways as a function of dose. Observing this trend with another pathway database provided additional conﬁdence with these results. A clear decrease with cardiac dysfunctions, PKD1, and ZMPSTE24 was revealed as a function of dose. Interestingly, deﬁciencies or decreases in both PKD1 [63] and ZMPSTE24 [64] expression have been previously shown to cause cardiac dysfunction. These observed biological functions seem to follow a trend that may have be missed by manual analysis. Lastly, less stringent statistics with an FDR <0.05 in only three of the GeneLab Datasets was also analyzed for C2 gene sets (Figures S10–S17). Like the C5 analysis, more gene sets were clustered per group after k-means clustering (Figure S10), leading to three clusters requiring additional k-means sub-clustering analysis (Figures S11–S13). This less statistically stringent analysis on C2 produced additional trends through the GAM ﬁts that were not observed in the more conservative analysis (Figures S14–S17). A clear decrease in TNF pathways was observed with increasing dose (Figure S16), and a novel pathway related to taste transduction was observed as increasing with dose (Figure S17). Interestingly, it has been reported that both olfactory pathways and taste are altered in astronauts, which was previously thought to be due to ﬂuid shifts in the head caused by microgravity conditions [ 65–67]. These data also indicate that space radiation may have some impact on this interesting phenomenon. Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 10 of 23 Cancers  2020 , 12, 381 10 of 24     Figure 6.

GSEA C6: Oncogenic Signatures To observe speciﬁc oncogenic pathways that may change as a function of space radiation exposure, we also included an analysis of the GSEA C6 oncology-speciﬁc collection from the molecular signatures database (Figure 7). From the annotation analysis, we discovered that the main oncogenic pathway Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 11 of 23 impacted by space radiation was KRAS (Figure 7A). KRAS is a known oncogene and has been heavily shown in the literature to be involved with lung cancer induced by space radiation [ 14]. The k-means clustering on the annotated gene sets produced the following ﬁve clusters: (1) KRAS- and LEF1-related pathways; (2) p53-, mTOR-, KRAS-, and CRX-related pathways; (3) PDGF- and TGF -related pathways; (4) TBK1, VEGFA, and ERBB2 pathways; and (5) embryonic stem cells (ESC) pathway (Figure 7B). When observing each cluster as a function of dose, there were interesting trends that can shed light on predicting potential oncogenic risk for longer exposure to space radiation. Thus, the following known oncogenes as well as the most regulated C6 oncogenic signatures were speciﬁcally analyzed as a function of dose for all datasets: (1) KRAS, (2) CSR, (3) p53, (4) ESC, (5) TGF , (6), VEGFa, and (7) mTOR pathways (Figure 8). These trends as a function of dose across multiple experimental datasets emphasized a need to functionally valid these observations. Cancers  2020 , 12, 381 12 of 24     Figure 7.

The circles in the plots represent the gene sets and the pink shade around the GAM ﬁts represent the standard error. As in the previous sections, we also performed analysis with less stringent statistics with a FDR <0.05 in only three of the GeneLab Datasets analyzed for C6 gene sets (Figures S18–S21). Because there are fewer gene sets in the C6 database, this analysis started to yield some of the same results as the analysis with the higher thresholds. The GAM ﬁts for each cluster and sub-cluster produced similar results, with one sub-cluster purely associated with TGF demonstrating the same trend (Figure S21). Interestingly, one cluster associated with TBK1 did not appear in the higher threshold analysis and demonstrated a clear decrease in as a function of dose (Figure S20). Lastly, a major oncogene MYC [ 68,69] did not show up in the higher threshold analysis, whereas in this analysis MYC was clearly being activated with increasing dose (Figure S20), indicating that space radiation exposure would increase the potential for carcinogenesis. 2.4. Common Genes as a Function of Dose and Association with Biological Pathways To look at speciﬁc genes that might be common across all datasets, we performed analysis on the log2 fold-change values for all datasets. Nine genes ( COPB2, UBE2D3, LYPLA2, ARF1, COPB1, CAPNS1, PHB2, DAD1, PRPF8 ) identiﬁed to be common across the spaceﬂight missions (1.0 to 30 mGy) and ground studies (0.1 to 1.0 Gy) were plotted as a function of dose and average log2 fold-change and ﬁt to a complex polynomial model. These genes, which were expressed across the various tissue types, displayed no signiﬁcant expression e ects from spaceﬂight up to 100 mGy. At doses higher than 100 mGy, a slight deviation from baseline expression was observed (Figure 9A). The spaceﬂight studies alone showed slight ﬂuctuations in expression across the identiﬁed gene sets (Figure 9B). A focused analysis of only the muscle tissue datasets identiﬁed a subset of nine di erent genes that were di erentially expressed across the spaceﬂight studies from 0 to 30 mGy (Figure 9C). These genes displayed dose-response trends. The nine common genes associated with all tissue types were associated with pathways centered on Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum transport and post-translational protein modiﬁcations (Figure 9D). In addition, these genes also were predicted to regulated phospholipid activity, immune dysregulation, and embryonic lethality. We observed these pathways to also be involved with our GSEA analysis as a function of dose. Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 13 of 23 Cancers 2020,  12, 381 13 of 24  multiple C6 pathways associated with that oncogene . The circles in the plots represent the gene sets  and the pink shade around the GAM fi ts represent the standard error.  As in the previous sections, we also performed analysis with less stringent sta tistics with a FDR <  0.05 in only three of the GeneLab Datasets analyzed for C6 gene sets (Figure S18–S21). Because there  are fewer gene sets in the C6 database, this analysis started to yield some of the same results as the  analysis with the higher thresholds. The GAM fits for each cluster and sub- cluster produced similar  results, with one sub-cluster purely associated with TGF β demonstrating the same trend (Figure S21).   Interestingly, one cluster associated with TBK1 di d not appear in the higher threshold analysis and  demonstra ted a clear decrease in a s a function of dose (Figure S20). Lastly, a major oncogene MYC  [68,69] did not show up in the higher threshold analysis, whereas in this analysis MYC was clearly  being activated with increasing dose (Figure S20), indicating that space radiation exposure would  increase the potential for carcinogenesis.    2.4.

Discussion Here, we presented a novel approach in using publicly available transcriptomic data to determine potential health risks and dysregulation of biological pathways as a function of space radiation exposure. The use of NASA’s GeneLab platform [ 23] allowed us to mine data that might not have otherwise been possible to obtain from individual experimental datasets. The large number of radiation datasets available through this platform allowed the creative combination of di erent datasets from former experiments to generate new hypotheses [71]. Our hypothesis for this work suspected that there was a tissue independent dysregulation as a function of space radiation-absorbed dose that impacted key biological pathways associated with increased health risks such as induction of cancer. Because the GeneLab Data System contains spaceﬂight transcriptomic data from mice and tissues ﬂown in low Earth orbit (LEO) for various time durations, we were able to obtain accumulated space radiation doses from 1 to 30 mGy. To obtain doses that will be more relevant to long-term deep space travel [ 7,14], we combined our analysis with simulated space radiation ground experiments performed in the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory [ 24]. These experiments were performed on both mice and in vitro cell cultures with single ions (protons,56Fe, and26Si) at doses from 100 to 1000 mGy. Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 14 of 23 By combining 25 GeneLab datasets over these doses, this work represents the ﬁrst time a study has provided a comprehensive biological analysis and produced relevant and novel results indicating which relevant biological processes are being regulated as a function of space radiation exposure. These results may be further utilized to generate health risk assessment models and uncover potential targets for mitigation of space radiation e ects via novel therapeutics. We chose to ﬁrst look at the distribution of mapping errors within the RNA-sequencing results from liver samples by examining whether mice exposure to spaceﬂight resulted in detectable changes compared to ground controls. We chose to focus on liver tissue datasets from GeneLab with mice exposed to space radiation because on in the GLDS liver is the organ with the largest number of sequenced tissue thus far from rodent research missions [ 71]. This extremely novel analysis demonstrates how RNA-sequence data can be used to generate useful data other than the standard techniques to generate counts. With a cumulative exposure of 9.20 mGy for GLDS-168 mice, signiﬁcant increases in A >G and C >T base substitutions were detected, as well as changes in CAC, CGT, GTA, or GTG error rates (Figure 1). However, there were no signiﬁcant base-speciﬁc substitutions detected, and CAC, CGT, GTA, or GTG error rates all decreased signiﬁcantly in GLDS-242 where mice received a cumulative dose of 8.03 mGy; however, due to the uncertainty inherent in the ﬂight dosimetry, it was not possible to deﬁnitively determine whether this was the case. A major di erence potentially impacting the observed di erences between GLDS-168 and GLDS-242 was the animal sacriﬁcing time at sample collection, which occurred during spaceﬂight for GLDS-168, but was 2 weeks after returning to Earth for GLDS-242. The recovery time for the mice after 2 weeks back on Earth might possibly allow recovery of the base substitutions and error rates observed during exposure to space radiation. The ability to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in RNA and DNA datasets has been performed previously on the basis of the assumption of a homogeneous genomic sample for example from a tumor [ 70], whereas the sporadic and stochastic nature of HZE exposure is expected to result in random damage throughout the genome [ 72]. Therefore, approaches to map SNVs on the basis of bulk tissue approaches may not be able to account for the stochastic nature of the SNV damage accumulated in a tissue. Our interpretation of these results was that the spaceﬂight animals may have experienced more DNA damage /mutation than ground controls, but in the animals that were returned to Earth, the recovery of the animals allowed for repair to take place. Next, purely on the basis of statistical analysis, we were able to determine key biological functions that were being dysregulated as a function of space radiation. For example, in the C5 Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Figure 5C), ribosomal pathways were observed as decreasing with dose. Ribosomal assembly consisted of a number of ribosomal protein large (rpl) genes that are necessary in the assembly of the eukaryotic ribosome 60S subunit, as well as the ribosomal protein small genes involved 40S and/or 60S subunit assembly. Indeed, ribosome-related genes have been previously reported to be disrupted following exposure to ionizing radiation [73–75]. We observed a clear trend of increased activation of mitochondrial-related pathways in multiple dierent pathway databases, which include both the C5 GO terms (Figure 5C) and C2 curated gene sets (Figure 6C). Mitochondrial gene expression is susceptible to radiation-sensitivity [ 76]. A number of gene sets in these clusters showed dysregulation of the NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDUF) gene family and mitochondria-related function, in agreement with e ects of ionizing radiation on the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in previous studies [ 77–79]. This is especially relevant to human health, as the NASA Twins Study recently revealed mitochondrial stress and increased mitochondrial debris in the blood [21]. A distinct elicitation of inﬂammatory and immune-related cellular functions was also observed in this analysis with alteration in chemokine, cytokine, and interferon expression (Figures 5C and 6C) . Indeed, it has been very well appreciated that ionizing radiation exposure will cause both pro-inﬂammatory and anti-inﬂammatory expression as cellular signals attempt to resolve the unique normal tissue radiation injury that occurs both acutely and longer-term [ 80–82]. This immune signaling dysregulation has also been reported to occur when exposed to space radiation [83,84]. Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 15 of 23 We also explored the potential cancer risk as a function of space radiation. The datasets we utilized for this study were from both in vitro and in vivo samples that did not have any cancer present and were not prone to induction of cancer. From our analysis, we observed several interesting results indicative of increased risk for the induction of cancer. In our analysis on the C6 Oncogenic Signature database, we observed that PDGF and TGF were clustered together, purely on the basis of the statistics, and both were decreasing with increasing dose (cluster 3 in Figure 7C). This observation is closely tied to previously established ﬁndings. In the literature, PDGF and TGF are closely related to cancer progression [ 85]. In addition, it has been shown in the clinic that decreases in PDGF and TGF levels after radiotherapy for breast cancer can cause echocardiographic alterations a ecting cardiovascular morbidity [ 86]. We also observed the highest frequency of the KRAS pathway, a known oncogene [ 87], being impacted as a function dose (Figure 7A). It has been previously described in experiments with single ion species that KRAS can induce lung cancer due to HZE particles [ 14]. Our tissue-independent analysis did not demonstrate any signiﬁcant induction of KRAS with increasing dose (cluster 1 in Figures 7C and 8). This might indicate that either previous experiments done with single ions at higher HZE doses did not capture the dose-dependent trend in tissues, or when considering the full spectrum of ions at lower doses KRAS might not be the key driver in inducing tumor growth. Other oncogenic trends we observed were decreases in CSR, ESC, TGF , VEGFA, and mTOR C6 pathway levels as a function of increasing radiation dose (Figures 7 and 8). TGF , VEGFa, and mTOR have all previously shown similar trends with increasing dose of simulated space radiation [ 32,88]. The ESC C6 term is refers to di erentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESC) [ 89]. This rather surprising result indicates that increasing dose of space radiation reduces the e ciency of stem cell di erentiation. It has been reported that after ionizing radiation exposure, mitochondria are heavily involved with stem cell development [ 90]. Exploiting these di erent pathway databases (i.e., GO, C2, and C6) provided key insights on how these di erent pathway trends are intertwined. The CSR C6 term refers to “common serum response” (CSR) speciﬁcally related to ﬁbroblast serum [ 91]. Fibroblast serum response refers to factors released in the serum from ﬁbroblasts involved in assisting with wound healing during tumorigenesis [ 91]. We can relate the decrease to the CSR pathways to what we observed in the GO analysis (cluster 3 in Figure 5) related to wound healing and VEGF pathways. We also observed with that wound healing should decrease with increasing doses of space radiation. This decrease can also reduce wound healing due to CSR and has shown that it can lead to tumorigenesis [ 91]. In addition, it has been reported that impairment occurs in space wound healing [92,93], and these data can potentially indicate an increased chance for tumor induction. These observed trends as a function of space radiation exposure revealed unique pathways that seem to be speciﬁcally related to GCR, whereas some pathways from our analysis are known to be universal responses to radiation. The mechanisms of damage are common to highly ionizing radiation regardless of the source [ 94]; what is unique to chronic space radiation exposure is the combination of highly ionizing particles, low dose, and a low dose rate, which may have implications for DNA repair [ 17], mitochondrial pathways [ 16], and lipid pathways [ 42] as just a few examples of what emerged from our analysis. In addition, we found speciﬁc cancer-related pathways that may be unique to space radiation. For example, decreases in TGF [32], embryonic stem cells (ESC) [ 95], and VEGFa seem to be unique to space radiation. Spaceﬂight studies have previously revealed a plethora of eects that radiation can have at individual doses or over a small range of discreet doses. However, the pooling and meta-analysis of these datasets in this study allowed for a unique visualization and comparison over a larger range of radiation doses. This in turn made it possible to identify trends in physiological response from low to high doses and provided insight into the response to accumulating doses that may occur in long duration space missions or over a few days during solar particle events. This technique may also be utilized to determine potential targets for therapeutic intervention. For example, because we report that mitochondrial pathways decrease as a function of space radiation, this argues for additional validation and research on speciﬁc mitochondrial targets for countermeasure development. In addition, from this analysis we can extrapolate to speciﬁc doses that may pose greater Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 16 of 23 health risks. This analysis can only be done by utilizing a large number of datasets that are available from platforms such as NASA’s GeneLab. The resolution obtained from this analysis can easily be lost once we lower the number datasets that will be used. Our analysis has indicated several di erent health risks that may occur with increasing exposure to space radiation. Through an unbiased technique purely driven by statistics and utilizing a large amount of transcriptomic data from NASA’s GeneLab platform, we were able to identify tissue-independent biological pathways that are dysregulated as a function of space radiation dose. We believe this technique can further be used with other datasets and databases to generate more hypotheses that will assist with determining optimal therapeutic countermeasures and targets that can mitigate space radiation response in humans. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Chromosomal and Subsitution Error Rate Mapping Two mouse liver RNA-sequencing datasets (GLDS-168 and GLDS-242) from NASA spaceﬂight experiments were speciﬁcally analyzed for chromosomal or substitution error rates. Compressed fastq ﬁles were cleaned using TRIM galore (v0.6.4, https: //github.com /FelixKrueger /TrimGalore /blob/master / Docs /Trim_Galore_User_Guide.md) to remove adapters and bases falling below a Q20 Phred quality score. Paired reads were aligned to the mouse mm10 reference genome using bowtie2 (v2.3.4.1,) and the output piped through samtools to generate a bam ﬁle. The bam ﬁle had read group information added and was coordinate sorted using Picard tools (v2.21.3,). Mapping metrics were calculated using Picard tools and ﬁnal mismatches (MN ﬂag) extracted with genomic coordinates using Bedtools (v2.26.0, https: //bedtools.readthedocs.io /en/latest /). Data were analyzed in R to determine the frequency of mismatches with respect to chromosome number and plotted. Mapping quality data from Picard tools was analyzed using GraphpadPrism (v7.0, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA). 4.2. Bioinformatics, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and Visulization Using Cytoscape The transcriptome datasets used for this study were from openly available data housed by NASA’s GeneLab platform (genelab.nasa.gov,). There was a total of 25 GeneLab datasets (GLDS) with 30 experimental comparisons from RNA-sequencing or microarray platforms (Table 1). Data pre-processing was performed as previously published to obtain normalized expression values for the majority of the datasets [ 32,33,42]. For GLDS-73, human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were exposed to gamma-rays (1 Gy or 3 Gy), iron (56Fe), or silicon (26Si) particles (0.5 Gy or 1 Gy each). RNA extraction was executed 1 hr after exposure and the transcriptome data were evaluate by microarray technology using the Illumina HumanWG-6 V2 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.) [ 52]. The raw data ﬁles were normalized using the quantile method and then background subtraction was performed using R Package PIMENTo (v1.0). Fold-change values between spaceﬂight /radiation exposure versus ground /control samples were calculated and used for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA,) with three molecular signature dataset collections (C2, C5, and C6 gene sets) [ 54]. These results were imported into Cytoscape (v3.7) for further visualization and interpretation by the Enrichment Map tool [ 96]. Only gene set nodes with a false-detection rate (FDR) <0.25 in at least 50% of the total datasets analyzed were considered for network evaluation. To reduce the complexity of the newly developed networks, we utilized the AutoAnnotate tool (v1.3.2, http: //baderlab.org /Software /AutoAnnotate) in Cytoscape to group-related gene set nodes together. The newly annotated gene sets were then used for further analysis. 4.3. Principal Component Analysis, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, k-Means Clustering, Heatmaps, and Generalized Additive Model Fits The GSEA-produced nominal enrichment scores (NES) were compared using principle component analysis (PCA) plots from the R-program pca3d (v0.10, https: //cran.r-project.org /web/packages /pca3d / Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 17 of 23 pca3d.pdf) [ 97], and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) plots using R-program Rtsne (v0.15, https: //cran.r-project.org /web/packages /Rtsne /Rtsne.pdf). Further characterization was performed by hierarchical k-means clustering on the NES. Heatmaps were generated using the R-program pheatmap (v1.0.12, https: //cran.r-project.org /web/packages /pheatmap /pheatmap.pdf). The auto-annotated gene sets for each k-means cluster were then plotted with the NES versus the dose for associated for each GeneLab dataset (Table 1) with R-program ggplot2 (v3.2.1,). Data points were then ﬁt using a generalized additive model (GAM) [ 55,56] across all dose ranges from 1 to 1000 mGy with R-program mgcv (v1.8-28, https: //cran.r-project.org /web/packages /mgcv /mgcv.pdf) 4.4. Analysis on Common Individual Genes with Fold-Change Values and Fits as a Function of Dose A total of 19 spaceﬂight studies and 3 ground studies were selected from the GeneLab database. Table 1 summarizes the datasets including the tissue, species, the radiation type, and the measured dose. From each study, the fold-change value between irradiated and control for each gene was calculated. For spaceﬂight studies, the log 2fold-change was computed as the ratio of the spaceﬂight measurement to a ground control value. In studies where terrestrial measurements for ground control values were made in both an animal enclosure module (AEM, also referred to as the Rodent Habitat) and a vivarium, the AEM ground control value was used due to the similar module conditions experienced by tissue in the spaceﬂight AEMs. For the terrestrial studies that simulated space radiation, the experimental values were the samples that were irradiated with a speciﬁc ion (i.e.,56Fe,26Si, or proton) compared to the sham unirradiated samples closest to the time of irradiation. Across all of the studies, the most common genes probed were chosen, which produced nine genes present with all the GLDS sets used for this manuscript. A polynomial of degree 2 was ﬁt to the data in the range 1–1000 mGy for all datasets. For ﬁts involving only spaceﬂight samples and only muscle tissues, due to the smaller range of doses up to 30 mGy, data were ﬁt using a polynomial of degree 1. All ﬁts were performed using a chi-square method via CERN’s ROOT toolkit (v.6.18 /02,) [ 98]. The nine genes were entered in ToppCluster [ 99] to determine the predicted pathways and functions these genes will impact. The results from ToppCluster were imported into Cytoscape, where the predicted functions were displayed as a network. 5. Conclusions This work is an example of how GeneLab’s rich database of omics experiments with animal models can be exploited to better understand the e ects of ionizing radiation and the resulting potential risks to humans. This large-scale analysis of multiple transcriptome datasets including RNA-sequencing and microarray datasets provides a valuable examination of dose-dependent perturbations of cellular function across multiple tissue types in animal models. Individually, these experiments were limited by ﬂight duration, resulting in a single accumulated dose from a micture of particles or, in ground-based studies, exposure to a single particle species. When analyzing multiple molecular databases using our approach to many omics datasets, a more comprehensive analysis of signiﬁcantly impacted biological factors can be obtained than was previously possible.

This study focuses on anhydrobiosis in tardigrades, which are known for their resilience to severe environmental conditions. Tardigrades utilize several protective mechanisms against desiccation, notably the constitutive expression of cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins in Ramazzottius varieornatus . These proteins share similarities in their amphiphatic alpha helices with late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, but differ  significantly  in their amino acid sequences. In this study, we further explored the functionality of CAHS proteins by analyzing their role in aggregation and tolerance to hyperosmotic stress in mammalian cells. Using live cell imaging, we examined the subcellular localization of several CAHS and LEA proteins in response to hyperosmotic stress. The expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 tended to enhance the resilience to the hyperosmotic conditions. These findings  not only deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of anhydrobiosis but also highlight the potential of CAHS proteins as cryoprotectants. Key words anhydrobiosis, Tardigrades, live imaging, disordered proteins, desiccation tolerance Cell Structure and Function 49: 123–133 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1247/csf.24035 123 Cell Structure and FunctionIntroduction Anhydrobiosis, derived from “life without water ” in Greek, is a phenomenon where an organism loses almost all of its water and enters a state of reversible ametabolism ( Crowe et al. , 1998 ; Keilin, 1959 ). An organism capable of anhydrobiosis tolerates extreme dehydration (desiccation), dries to equilibrium with moderately to extremely dry air, and then restores its vital functions after rehydration. Anhydrobiosis is observed in both microorganisms and animals, including bacteria, nematodes, seeds, spores, gemma, lichen soredium, egg, shoot fragments, and more ( García, 2011 ; Hibshman et al. , 2020 ; Leprince and Buitink, 2015 ). Desiccation primarily damages proteins, nucleic acids, and membrane lipids, leading to cell death. Therefore, living organisms that exhibit anhydrobiosis have protective mechanisms to mitigate desiccation. Trehalose accumulation (Crowe et al. , 1998 ; Lapinski and Tunnacliffe,  2003 ), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins ( Goyal et al. , 2005 ; Kikawada et al. , 2006 ; MacRae, 2016 ), heat shock proteins (Cornette et al. , 2010 ; King and MacRae, 2015 ), and ROS scavenging ( Gusev et al. , 2010 ; Rizzo et al. , 2010 ) have been proposed as mechanisms of desiccation tolerance ( Janis et al. , 2018 ). Tardigrades, widely used as model organisms for anhydrobiosis research, exhibit extreme tolerance to high and low temperatures, high pressure, and radiation in their anhydrobiotic state ( Rebecchi et al. , 2007 ; Wright, 2001 ). Although several reports have been reported on the defense mechanisms underlying anhydrobiosis in tardigrades, including induction of heat shock proteins and defensive peroxidases (Reuner et al. , 2010 ; Rizzo et al. , 2010 ; Schokraie et al. , 2011 ; Yoshida et al. , 2022 ), cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins, identified  as a family of highly hydrophilic and heat- soluble proteins, have attracted much attention. CAHS proteins are constitutively expressed in Ramazzottius varieornatus , which exhibits strong desiccation tolerance without de novo  gene expression. On the other hand, in another tardigrade, Hypsibius exemplaris , the expression of CAHS proteins is strongly induced under desiccated condition, and these expressions are essential for desiccation tolerance ( Arakawa, 2022 ; Kondo et al. , 2015 , 2019 ; Yoshida et al. , 2017 ). CAHS proteins share some similarities with LEA proteins in terms of bioinformatic Abbreviations CAHS  cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble LEA  late embryogenesis abundant LEAM  late embryogenesis abundant protein mitochondrial MAHS  mitochondrial abundant heat soluble mEGFP  monomeric enhanced green fluorescent  protein psi pound per square inch WST  water-soluble tetrazolium LDH  lactate dehydrogenase Dox doxycycline IC50  half inhibitory concentration EC50  half effective  concentration IDR intrinsically disordered regionpredictions of a strong tendency for amphiphatic α-helix formation, despite their low amino acid sequence similarity to LEA proteins. Recently, several groups, including ours, have reported that the CAHS proteins demonstrate gelation, droplet, or fibrous  structures in vitro  and in cells ( Malki et al. , 2022 ; Tanaka et al. , 2022 ; Veling et al. , 2022 ; Yagi-Utsumi et al. , 2021 ). It has also been shown that the heterologous expression of CAHS proteins suppresses hyperosmotic pressure-induced cell death of budding yeast, bacteria, and Drosphila  S2 cells ( Boothby et al. , 2017 ; Tanaka et al. , 2022 ). However, it remains unclear whether the heterologous expression of CAHS proteins confers hyperosmotic stress tolerance to cultured mammalian cells. In this study, we show the changes in the subcellular localization of R. varieornatus  CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, CAHS12, late embryogenesis abundant protein mitochondrial (LEAM), and mitochondrial abundant heat soluble (MAHS) proteins upon hyperosmotic stress stimulation by live cell imaging in mammalian cultured cells. We also investigated the tolerance to hyperosmotic stress by the expression of CAHS proteins, and found that the expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, or CAHS8 rendered the cells tolerant to the hyperosmotic stress. Methods Plasmid construction All plasmids used in this study are summarized in Table S1, along with Benchling links to the plasmid sequences and maps. Plasmids were constructed by standard molecular biology methods. The cDNAs of R. varieornatus  CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, CAHS12, LEAM, and MAHS were synthesized with codon optimization for the human genome using gBlocks Gene Fragments (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) and inserted into the pCAGGS vector ( Niwa et al. , 1991 ) for transient expression experiments ( Fig. 1 ) and the pT2A vector (pT2Apuro-rtTA2-TRE) for drug-inducible expression experi- ments ( Fig. 2  and 3). Of note, since CAHS proteins are known to be abundantly expressed in tardigrades, we optimized the codon of the CAHS genes in order to express sufficient  amounts of CAHS proteins in HeLa cells. The Tol2-based transposon donor vector (pT2A) and the Tol2 transposase expression vector (pCAGGS-T2TP) were kindly provided by Koichi Kawakami (National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan) ( Kawakami and Noda, 2004 ). The cDNAs of rtTA ( Roney et al. , 2016 ) synthesized by FASMAC, tet-response element, and multiple cloning sites were inserted into a Tol2 donor vector by ligation and Gibson assembly to generate pTol2puro-rtTA2-TRE-MCS. The cDNAs of monomeric enhanced green fluorescent  protein (mEGFP), CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, CAHS8-mEGFP, and CAHS12- mEGFP were subcloned into the pT2Apuro-rtTA2-TRE-MCS vector.T.

The mEGFP expression in each cell is shown as a box plot, in which the box extends from the first to the third quartile with the whiskers denoting 1.5 times the interquartile range. The numbers of cells are as follows: mEGFP, n = 238 and 373 (Dox – and Dox+); CAHS1-mEGFP, n = 68 and 298 (Dox – and Dox+); CAHS3-mEGFP, n = 107 and 172 (Dox – and Dox+); CAHS8-mEGFP, n = 245 and 364 (Dox–  and Dox+); CAHS12-mEGFP, n = 61 and 286 (Dox – and Dox+). The symbols indicate the results of t-test analysis; ** p<0.01 compared with the Dox – data.

In these heatmaps, red color indicates a higher number of viable cells. The average values are shown based on three independent experiments. (C) The mean of an IC50 value of cell viability against sorbitol before and after doxycycline treatment are shown as a bar graph with S.D. (n = 3). Although t-test was conducted for the data compared with the mEGFP data, the statistical significance  was not observed.mEGFP protein, the CAHS3-mEGFP, the CAHS8-mEGFP, the CAHS12-mEGFP, the LEAM-mEGFP, the MAHS-mEGFP and the mEGFP were transfected into the HeLa cells with 293fectinTM Transfection Reagent (#12347-019, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were loaded onto a microfluidic  plate (M04S-03-5PK, Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer ’s instructions. The microfluidic plates were controlled by a CellASIC ONIX2 Microfluidic  System (CAX2-S0000, Millipore). After 48 h of transfection, the culture medium was replaced with an imaging medium containing FluoroBriteTM DMEM (#A1896701, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 1% GlutaMAXTM Supplement (#35050061, Thermo Fisher Scientific)  and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The imaging medium continuously flowed  at 5 psi ( “psi”  is a unit of pressure) while heating at 37°C by a temperature-controllable manifold (CAX2-MXT20, Millipore). For hyperosmotic shock experiments, 0.5 M sorbitol solution and 0.2 M sodium chloride solution were prepared as follows: 4.5 M sorbitol in DDW and 5 M sodium chloride in DDW were dissolved by the imaging medium, resulting in 0.5 M sorbitol solution and 0.2 M sodium chloride solution, respectively. The transfected cells seeded on microfluidic  plates were time-lapse imaged under the imaging medium condition every 10 sec for 2 min. The imaging medium continuously flowed  at 1 psi while heating at 37°C. Then, 0.5 M sorbitol solution or 0.2 M sodium chloride solution was added, and fluorescence  images were acquired every 10 sec for 5 min. The hyperosmotic medium continuously flowed  at 5 psi while heating at 37°C. After incubation, the hyperosmotic medium was replaced with the imaging medium, and the cells were observed every 10 sec for 10 min. The imaging medium continuously flowed  at 5 psi while heating at 37°C. Cells were imaged with an inverted microscope (IX83, Olympus/ Evident, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an sCMOS camera (ORCA-Fusion BT, Hamamatsu photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan), a spinning disk confocal unit (CSU-W1, Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Musashino, Japan), and diode lasers at a wavelength of 488 nm. An oil immersion objective lens (UPLXAPO100XO, N.A. 1.45, Olympus/Evident) was used. The excitation laser and fluorescence  filter  settings were as follows: excitation laser, 488 nm; dichroic mirror (DM), 405/488/561 nm; and emission filters,  500 –550 nm. During the observation, the cells were incubated with microfluidic  plates at 37°C. The microscope was controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Fluorescence imaging data were analyzed and quantified  in Fiji/ImageJ ( Schindelin et al. , 2012 ). The background was subtracted by a constant value. If salt-and-pepper noise was not negligible, a median filter  with 1-pixel was applied. To compensate for the misregistration caused during time-lapse imaging, the “StackReg function ” was applied with the “Translation” option.Osmotic stress resistance by CAHS1 expression Cell Structure and Function 49: 123–133 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1247/csf.24035 127 Cell Structure and FunctionFluorescence imaging for quantifying expression levels HeLa cells carrying the doxycycline-inducible expression cassette of CAHS1, 3, 8, 12-mEGFP or mEGFP were seeded on a 96-well plate (#167008, Thermo Fisher Scientific).  One day after seeding, the cells were treated with the indicated concentration of doxycycline, and 24 h after doxycycline treatment, the cells were observed with a fluorescence  microscope. The cells were imaged with an inverted microscope (IX81, Olympus/Evident) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Retiga 4000R, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA), an excitation light source (Spectra-X light engine, Lumencor Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA), a laser-based autofocus system (IX2-ZDC, Olympus/ Evident), a controller for filter  wheels and XY stage (MAC5000, Ludl Electronic Products, Hawthorne, NY, USA), and an incubation chamber (STXG-IX3WX, Tokai Hit, Fujinomiya, Japan). An objective lens (UPlanApo 10x, N.A. 0.40, Olympus/Evident) was used. For EGFP imaging, a 475/28 excitation filter,  a 20/80 beamsplitter dichroic mirror (Chroma Technology Corp., Bellows Falls, VT, Japan), and a 542/27 emission filter  (Semrock, IDEX Health & Science, LLC, West Henrietta, NY, USA) were used. During the observation, live cells were incubated in a stage incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. The microscope was controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). The fluorescence  imaging data were analyzed and quantified in Fiji/ImageJ ( Schindelin et al. , 2012 ). The background was subtracted by the rolling ball method. The region of interest (ROI) of each cell was extracted with the “StarDistD2”  function (Probability/Score Threshold: 0.55), and the fluorescence intensity (Mean value) of each ROI was obtained with the “Measure” function. Cell viability assay and cell death assay For the cell viability assay and the cell death assay, a low serum concentration medium (1% FBS), hereinafter referred to as the assay medium, was used to reduce the background absorbance in the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay because serum contains LDH. The assay medium contains 1x DME culture solution (#639-29631, Nitta Gelatin, Yao, Japan), 1% FBS, 26 mM NaHCO3 (#09655-25, Nacalai Tesque), and 1 μg/mL puromycin (if needed). For hyperosmotic stress, a 3.2 M sorbitol solution in the assay medium was prepared by mixing 4.5 M sorbitol in DDW, 5x DME culture solution, 260 mM NaHCO3, 100% FBS, DDW, and 1 mg/mL puromycin. This 3.2 M sorbitol solution in the assay medium was serially diluted with the assay medium to produce the indicated concentration of sorbitol solution. For drug-inducible gene expression, 1 mg/mL doxycycline (#D4116, Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan) was serially diluted with the assay medium to produce the indicated concentration of doxycycline solution in the assay medium. HeLa cells were plated on 96-well plates (7.5 × 102 – 3.0 × 103cells/well) (#167425, Thermo Fisher Scientific),  and cultured in the assay medium for 24 h. To induce gene expression, the cells were treated with doxycycline for 24 h, followed by the treatment with sorbitol solution for 24 h. For the simultaneous cell viability assay and cell death assay ( Fig. 2 ), half of the cell supernatant was used for the water-soluble tetrazolium (WST)-1 assay with a Premix WST-1 Cell Proliferation Assay System (#MK400, TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan) and the other half for the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay with an LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (#MK401, TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer’ s instructions. Both the WST-1 and LDH release assays were evaluated based on absorbance at 450 nm (and 620 nm as a control) using a microplate reader (#51119000, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The absorbance values obtained from the microplate reader were exported and analyzed by Python (ver. 3.7.3). First, the absorbance values were subtracted from the value obtained from the well containing only the assay medium. Second, the subtracted values were normalized by the following equation: Y  =   X−Low /High −Low where Y is the normalized value, X is the experimental data, and High  and Low are the highest and lowest values of the data obtained on the same day, respectively. For the cell viability assay in Fig. 2 , the High and Low values were obtained from the maximum and minimum values on the same day, respectively. In Fig. 3 , where the bulk population cell lines were used, the High and Low values were obtained from the value of the well in the absence of sorbitol and the minimum values on the same day, respectively. For the cell death assay, the High and Low values were taken from the value using Triton X-100 treated cells and the lowest values on the same day, respectively. Of note, the absolute number of cells seeded on the well plate varied between experiments, even though the number of cells was counted and the same number of cells were seeded between experiments. Therefore, the “High”  and “Low”  values were changeable. In addition, the LDH assay requires the supernatant to be taken from each well. These factors and procedures would cause the large variation between experiments. The normalized values were used to generate maps using the seaborn library in Python ( Figs. 2 D, 3B, S1, S2 and S3). The normalized data were fitted  with the following functions using the scipy.optimize. corve_ fit in Python: WST x=max −min∗IC50n/xn+IC50n+min LDH x=max −min∗xn/xn+EC50n+min where WST(x)  and LDH(x)  are the fitted  WST and LDH values, x is the sorbitol concentration, max and min are the maximum and minimum values, n is the Hill coefficient,  and IC50  and EC50  areT.

Structure prediction by AlphaFold2 The predicted structures of CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12 were obtained from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database ( https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/ ). Direct links are as follows: CAHS1 ( https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/J7M799), CAHS3 ( https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/J7M3T1 ), CAHS8 (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/A0A1D1UQN2 ), and CAHS12 (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/A0A1D1VNN8). Results and Discussion Hyperosmotic stress-induced changes in the subcellular localization of CAHS, LEAM, and MAHS proteins in HeLa cells We examined changes in the subcellular localization of anhydrobiosis-related proteins in R. varieornatus  induced by hyperosmotic stress, which is thought to be an early step in anhydrobiosis. Six types of proteins, including CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12, mitochondrial LEA (LEAM), and mitochondrial abundant heat soluble (MAHS), were separately expressed as mEGFP-fused protein in HeLa cells ( Fig. 1 A). We selected CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12 because they reversibly form different  types of aggregates in response to osmotic stimulation ( Tanaka et al. , 2022 ; Yagi-Utsumi et al. , 2021 ), but their roles in osmotic stress resistance have not been investigated except for CAHS3 ( Tanaka et al. , 2022 ). The cells were loaded into a microfluidic  chamber for rapid osmolyte solution perfusion. One day after loading into the microfluidic chamber, the cells were imaged with a spinning disk conformal microscope to visualize the subcellular distribution of these fusion proteins upon hyperosmotic stress such as 0.5 M sorbitol or 0.2 M NaCl ( Fig. 1 B). Of note, NaCl is the principal determinant of tonicity of the extracellular fluid (Burg et al. , 2007 ). However, cell membranes are permeable to Na+, and elevated chloride specifically  increases the expression of α-Na+-K+-ATPase (Capasso et al. , 2003 ). For this reason, poorly permeating organic solutes like sorbitol, mannitol, or raffinose  are often used to produce hypertonicity ( Burg et al. , 2007 ). HeLa cells expressing mEGFP treated with the osmolytes showed increased fluorescence  signal in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and puncta formation in the nucleus ( Fig. 1 C and Movie 1). These changes were reverted to the basal state by osmolyte washout ( Fig. 1 C). Under unstressed conditions, CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS8-mEGFP, and CAHS12-mEGFP were broadly distributed in both the cytosol and nucleus, whereas CAHS3-mEGFP was mainly localized in the cytosol ( Fig. 1 D–G and Movies 2 –5). When exposed to hyperosmotic medium supplemented with 0.5 M sorbitol or 0.2 M NaCl, these CAHS proteins formed different aggregation patterns; CAHS1-mEGFP mainly forms granules andfilamentous  structures and slightly accumulates at the plasma membrane ( Fig. 1 D and Movie 2). CAHS3-mEGFP shows fibrous structures in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 1 E and Movie 3). CAHS8- mEGFP seems to have the same pattern as mEGFP, but it slightly accumulates at the nuclear membrane ( Fig. 1 F and Movie 4). CAHS12-mEGFP appears to undergo decomposition in the nucleus ( Bracha et al. , 2018 ), while it exhibits granules and filamentous  structures ( Fig. 1 G and Movie 5). These results are, for the most part, consistent with previous reports ( Tanaka et al. , 2022 ; Yagi-Utsumi et al. , 2021 ). Interestingly, CAHS proteins appear to behave differently  between 0.5 M sorbitol and 0.2 M NaCl osmotic stress. For example, CAHS1 did not aggregate at the cell membrane under 0.2 M NaCl stress, but showed strong aggregation in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 1 D). CAHS12 also showed strong aggregation at the nuclear membrane and plasma membrane upon 0.5 M sorbitol and 0.2 M NaCl, respectively ( Fig. 1G). Regardless of whether the aggregate forms granules or filaments  during hyperosmotic stress, mEGFP and all CAHS protein condensates show rapid disassembly and restoration of coherent distribution upon the release of stress. It is reasonable to conclude that these rapid aggregation and disassembly processes are attributed to the biophysical properties of both mEGFP and each CAHS protein. Such efficient  reversible phase transitioning mirrors the relatively fast induction and recovery of tardigrade anhydrobiosis. The varying modes of aggregation and localization patterns of different  CAHS paralogs upon hyperosmotic stress suggest that these paralogs serve differentiated  functions rather than for mere redundancy. Emerging tissue-specific  expression patterns of tardigrade anhydrobiosis-related proteins ( Tanaka et al. , 2023 ) could be part of the reasons for such differentiation. It has been reported that two mitochondrial heat-soluble proteins, LEAM and MAHS, in R. varieornatus  improve the hyperosmotic tolerance of human cells, possibly by acting as mitochondrial protectants ( Tanaka et al. , 2015 ). Therefore, we investigated the subcellular localization of LEAM and MAHS in HeLa cells stimulated by hyperosmotic stress. Under unstressed conditions, LEAM-mEGFP and MAHS-mEGFP were localized to the mitochondria, and LEAM-mEGFP was weakly distributed in the cytosol and nucleus ( Fig. 1 H and I). Hyperosmotic stress arrested the random movement of mitochondria, but did not substantially change the subcellular localization of LEAM- mEGFP and MAHS-mEGFP ( Fig. 1 H and I). Removal of osmolytes by replacement with an isosmotic medium resumed the thermal fluctuation  of the mitochondria. Based on the fact that both LEAM and MAHS proteins localize to mitochondria and are highly hydrophilic ( Tanaka et al. , 2015 ), LEAM and MAHS are likely to be localized to the mitochondrial matrix. Taken together, these results suggest that the resistance to hyperosmotic stress by LEAM and MAHS expression is not cell-wide protection as observed for CAHS proteins, so we focused on the CAHS proteins for our subsequent analyses.Osmotic stress resistance by CAHS1 expression Cell Structure and Function 49: 123–133 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1247/csf.24035 129 Cell Structure and FunctionCAHS1 expression renders HeLa cells resistant to hyperosmotic stress Recent studies have elucidated that the CAHS3 protein forms fibrillar  aggregates under hyperosmotic conditions in mammalian cells, thereby enhancing their tolerance to hyperosmotic stress, as observed in Drosophila  S2 cells ( Tanaka et al. , 2022 ). However, the question remained as to whether other CAHS proteins, which exhibit varied aggregation patterns under elevated osmotic pressure, also contribute to augmented resistance to such conditions. To this end, we developed a method for quantitatively assessing osmotic stress resistance using HeLa cells expressing CAHS1 ( Fig. 2 A). We first established a single-cell clone of HeLa cells, expressing CAHS1- mEGFP in a manner dependent on doxycycline treatment. The experimental procedure was as follows: One day after cell seeding, doxycycline was added to induce CAHS1-mEGFP expression for two days, followed by different  concentrations of sorbitol as osmolite. Cell viability and increased cell death were evaluated using the WST-1 and LDH assays, respectively (see Methods for details)( Fig. 2 B). We first confirmed  the increase in CAHS1-mEGFP expression levels when we treated the cells with doxycycline ( Fig. 2 C). Despite performing single-cell cloning, the variation in the expression levels of CAHS1-mEGFP between cells was unexpectedly large. Under this condition, the cells were further exposed to hyperosmotic stress. Cell viability was strongly inhibited even in 0.1 M sorbitol in the absence of doxycycline (Fig. 2 D, left, first row, and Fig. S1). The increase in CAHS1- mEGFP expression attenuated the decrease in cell viability by hyperosmotic stress with sorbitol ( Fig. 2 D, left, and Fig. S1). The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) increased depending on the CAHS1-mEGFP expression level ( Fig. 2 E, left). Parental HeLa cells as a negative control showed no change in cell viability with or without doxycycline treatment ( Fig. 2 E, right). In line with the cell viability assay, the number of hyperosmotic stress-induced cell death was also reduced by the expression of CAHS1-mEGFP ( Fig. 2 D, right, and Fig. S1). The half-maximal effective  concentration (EC50) demonstrated a tendency to elevate with increasing expression of CAHS1-mEGFP ( Fig. 2 F, left). As a negative control, doxycycline treatment did not affect the EC50 values of sorbitol-induced cell death in parental HeLa cells ( Fig. 2 F, right). These results suggest that CAHS1 expression confers resistance to hyperosmotic stress in HeLa cells. CAHS1-mEGFP localizes to aggregates and fibrous structures and even to the plasma membrane at high osmotic pressure ( Fig. 1 D), suggesting that CAHS1 exerts some protective function against osmotic stress at these sites. It should be noted that the time-scales of CAHS1 aggregation (~5 min) is much faster than the inhibition of cell proliferation and cell death (~24 h) in response to hyperosmotic stress. This difference  may explain the non-linear relationship between CAHS1 expression level ( Fig. 2 C) and the effects  of sorbitol oncell viability ( Fig. 2 E) and cell death ( Fig. 2 F). In addition, in this study, the single-cell clone of HeLa cells stably expressing CAHS1-mEGFP indicated lower IC50 values for cell viability and EC50 values for cell death in response to sorbitol stimulation in the absence of doxycycline than parental HeLa cells ( Fig. 2 E and 2F). This may be because the single-cell clones established in this study happen to retain such properties. Further investigation would be needed in future studies to address this concern. Expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, or CAHS8 confers osmotic stress resistance to HeLa cells We next examined the other CAHS proteins for their ability to confer osmotic stress tolerance to HeLa cells. To simplify the experiment, HeLa cell lines were established that express mEGFP, CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, CAHS8-mEGFP, and CAHS12-mEGFP in a doxycycline-dependent manner. Of note, these HeLa cell lines were bulk population cells, but not single- cell clones, because it takes longer time to establish the single- cell clones. First, we quantified  the CAHS expression levels induced by doxycycline treatment in these HeLa cells, and found that doxycycline treatment elevated CAHS expression levels several-fold ( Fig. 3 A). The greater cellular heterogeneity compared to the single-cell cloned CAHS1-mEGFP cell line ( Fig. 2C) may be because these cell lines are bulk population cells that have not been subjected to single-cell cloning. Second, we examined the changes in cell viability in these cell lines upon hyperosmotic stress with sorbitol using the WST-1 assay. The average cell viability of each cell line under conditions without and with doxycycline is shown in the heat map ( Fig. 3 B). Even before doxycycline treatment, cell viability was higher in cells expressing CAHS1-mEGFP and CAHS8-mEGFP, but not CAHS3- mEGFP and CAHS12-mEGFP, than in control mEGFP-expressing cells ( Fig. 3 B, left). This may be because leakage of CAHS1 or CAHS8 proteins prior to doxycycline treatment contributes to tolerance to high osmotic pressure, while the expression levels of CAHS3 and CAHS12 did not reach the critical thresholds. In addition, doxycycline treatment rendered CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, or CAHS8-mEGFP expressing cells more resistant to higher concentrations of sorbitol than control mEGFP-expressing cells ( Fig. 3 B, right). In our hand, CAHS1- mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, CAHS8-mEGFP, or CAHS12-mEGFP expressing cells have rather increased cell viability under low concentrations of sorbitol ( Fig. 3 B, right). At this time, we do not know whether this is a result of variability in our experiments or whether the CAHS proteins potentiate cell viability under low concentrations of sorbitol. To quantitatively evaluate the resistance to hyperosmotic stress, we calculated the ratio of the IC50 value of cell viability against sorbitol after doxycycline treatment to that before doxycycline treatment. The IC50 values of CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, and CAHS8-mEGFP cells increased by 10 –20% in a doxycycline-dependent manner ( Fig. 3C). No increase in the ratio of IC50 values was observed inT. Bino et al. 130 Cell Structure and Function 49: 123–133 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1247/csf.24035 Cell Structure and FunctionmEGFP or CAHS12-mEGFP cells. Although the p-value ( p = 0.058 for CAHS1 compared with mEGFP) indicated that the observed difference  was not statistically significant,  the data suggest a potential trend toward increased resistance to osmotic stress through CAHS1 expression, which may warrant further investigation. The expression level of CAHS12 remained relatively low compared to CAHS3 and CAHS8, which had comparable expression levels before doxycycline treatment ( Fig. 3A). We have previously shown that CAHS1 condensation displays concentration-dependent sigmoidal threshold-like behavior between 0.3 –0.6 mM at neutral pH ( Tanaka et al. , 2022 ; Yagi-Utsumi et al. , 2021 ); therefore, there still remains the possibility that the CAHS12 concentration did not exceed the critical threshold. Nevertheless, from these results, we conclude that overexpression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 moderately confers tolerance to hyperosmotic stress in HeLa cells, and it is regardless of the mode of aggregation, whether granular or fibrous. Finally, we investigated the structure of the CAHS proteins in AlphaFold ( Jumper et al. , 2021 ; Varadi et al. , 2022 ), and found that CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12 all share a single long α-helix and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) at the N- and C-termini ( Fig. 4 ); CAHS3 and CAHS12 have a predicted structure at the N-terminus, but their confidence  is low. Despite the close structural similarity between CAHS proteins, the subcellular localization of these CAHS proteins under high osmotic pressure differed  from each other ( Fig. 1 ). As shown in the previous report, CAHS3 shows a coiled-coil structure and forms a fibrous  structure, thereby stabilizing the cell structure and increasing the resistance to high osmotic pressure ( Tanaka et al. , 2022 ). We have demonstrated that CAHS1 and CAHS8 localize to granules, plasma membrane, and nuclear membrane at high osmotic pressure ( Fig. 1 ), suggesting that CAHS1 and CAHS8 may protect organelles such as plasma membrane and nuclear membrane from hyperosmotic stimuli. These diverse aggregation patterns of CAHS proteins may coordinate anhydrobiosis in tardigrades. Conclusion In this study, we expressed R. varieornatus  CAHS proteins in HeLa cells to investigate their effects  on resistance to hyper- osmotic stress, an early step in anhydrobiosis. All of these proteins demonstrated reversible aggregation upon hyper- osmotic stress in HeLa cells, exhibiting granular and filamentous structures ( Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, we found that expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 conferred resistance to sorbitol- induced hyperosmotic stress in HeLa cells ( Figs. 2  and 3). These results not only provide new insights into the mechanism of desiccation tolerance in R. varieornatus , but also suggest a potential use of these CAHS proteins as cryoprotectants.Fundings This work was financially  supported in part by grants from the MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI (22H02625 and 24H01416) to K.

Trehalose accumulation (Crowe et al. , 1998 ; Lapinski and Tunnacliffe, 2003 ), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins ( Goyal et al. , 2005 ; Kikawada et al. , 2006 ; MacRae, 2016 ), heat shock proteins (Cornette et al. , 2010 ; King and MacRae, 2015 ), and ROS scavenging ( Gusev et al. , 2010 ; Rizzo et al. , 2010 ) have been proposed as mechanisms of desiccation tolerance ( Janis et al. , 2018 ). We also investigated the tolerance to hyperosmotic stress by the expression of CAHS proteins, and found that the expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, or CAHS8 rendered the cells tolerant to the hyperosmotic stress. 2 and 3).

Although t-test was conducted for the data compared with the mEGFP data, the statistical significance was not observed.mEGFP protein, the CAHS3-mEGFP, the CAHS8-mEGFP, the CAHS12-mEGFP, the LEAM-mEGFP, the MAHS-mEGFP and the mEGFP were transfected into the HeLa cells with 293fectinTM Transfection Reagent (#12347-019, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). HeLa cells were plated on 96-well plates (7.5 × 102 – 3.0 × 103cells/well) (#167425, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and cultured in the assay medium for 24 h. To induce gene expression, the cells were treated with doxycycline for 24 h, followed by the treatment with sorbitol solution for 24 h. For the simultaneous cell viability assay and cell death assay ( Fig. Taken together, these results suggest that the resistance to hyperosmotic stress by LEAM and MAHS expression is not cell-wide protection as observed for CAHS proteins, so we focused on the CAHS proteins for our subsequent analyses.Osmotic stress resistance by CAHS1 expression Cell Structure and Function 49: 123–133 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1247/csf.24035 129 Cell Structure and FunctionCAHS1 expression renders HeLa cells resistant to hyperosmotic stress Recent studies have elucidated that the CAHS3 protein forms fibrillar aggregates under hyperosmotic conditions in mammalian cells, thereby enhancing their tolerance to hyperosmotic stress, as observed in Drosophila S2 cells ( Tanaka et al. , 2022 ). In addition, in this study, the single-cell clone of HeLa cells stably expressing CAHS1-mEGFP indicated lower IC50 values for cell viability and EC50 values for cell death in response to sorbitol stimulation in the absence of doxycycline than parental HeLa cells ( Fig. 2 and 3)."

It has been over 50 years since the ﬁrst human walked on the Moon. Since then, most commercialized space ﬂights have been contracts granted to private companies by various governments to launchsatellites, e.g., communication and GPS devices, into Earth ’so r b i t .I n recent years, the de ﬁnition of commercial space ﬂight has expanded to include human transportation between Earth and habitats in Low EarthOrbit and future lunar or other extraterrestrial outposts. Onceconsidered nearly impossible, commercial space travel is now a reality, due to rapid technological advancement in the private sector, large-scale investment from governments, and continued public interest.With the ﬁrst crewed launch of SpaceX Dragon to the International Space Station (ISS), on May 30, 2020 1, a new era of public-private space ﬂight partnership has emerged.

NASA has further partnered withAxiom Space for commercial utilization of the ISS until the world ’sﬁrst commercial space station is built by 2028 2. There is currently a wide range of private/commercial space ﬂights, ranging from suborbital ﬂights lasting mere minutes to Axiom ’s 1-2 week ISS missions to the ﬁrst all-civilian orbital commercial space ﬂight mission referred to as ‘Inspiration4 ’(I4), comparable in duration (and health risks) to orbital shuttle missions1–3. Historically, government-sponsored space ﬂights were mission- based and geared towards national interests, e.g., technological lea-dership, improving national security, creating high-quality jobs, oradvancements in research. After the Cold War era and the “Space Race, ”government investment in space exploration declined. In con- trast, the idea of commercial space ﬂight continues to gain signi ﬁcant popularity and the economic opportunities linked to this are enor- mous. This has been accompanied by an in ﬂux of investment and the development of new technology, such as initial viable Reusable LaunchVehicle models by SpaceX 4. Despite this rapid technology develop- ment, governmental regulation of commercial space ﬂight lags behind. There are some requirements commercial space ﬂight providers have to meet, including requirements concerning environmental safety,payload, payload re-entry, ﬁnancial stability, and coverage for max- imum probable loss 5. Yet, there has been only limited regulation concerning the selection and training of non-government-sponsoredastronauts and no formal oversight governing medical research on such crews, whether orbital or suborbital. The United Nations Of ﬁce for Outer Space Affairs has collated national space laws relating tospace activities from 42 countries 6. While the regulations listed there cover a wide range of ﬁelds, such as objects in space, radio- communication, and space activities, there is a general lack of health-associated regulations. This is a symptom of a bigger problem wherethere is little oversight of private sector space ﬂight participants which, with Inspiration4, dearMoon 7, and the upcoming Polaris program8,a r e already a reality. An increase in commercial/private and civilian space missions with a more diverse crew may provide an opportunity to collect data on health issues in space. While these data could shape medical stan- dards and improve treatment choices for prolonged space ﬂight, their collection and management should require strict regulation. At thesame time, as spacefarers shift from professionally trained astronautsto private individuals without rigorous preparation or with existingmedical conditions, there is a need to re ﬁne selection criteria and training for non-governmental space travelers. Yet, despite theirimportance and urgency, these considerations have gone relativelyunexplored 9. In this paper, we will lay out several pressing issues related to ethical considerations for selecting space travelers and research practices, especially in the context of non-governmental and private space operations. Although there are many other ethical issues relatedto space exploration –both commercial and otherwise 10–19–our focus here is on ethical considerations regarding selection and human sub-ject research. Note that while some of the issues we raise might becovered by guidelines, regulations, or law, this does not diminish theethical considerations we discuss. A good example illustrating thispoint is NASA ’s recent decision to unify the effective radiation expo- sure for male and female astronauts so as to not exceed 600 mSv,which translates to having to remain below 3% mean risk of cancermortality above the non-exposed baseline mean, despite differences inmale and female radiation-based cancer risk 20,21. This decision is highly controversial, precisely because it is viewed by many as ethically pro- blematic. Likewise, signing a consent form to undertake a certainactivity (whether employer-mandated or not) does not make theproposed activity or consent process ethically unquestionable 21. Indeed, our point here is that ethical considerations resulting from theincrease in private and commercial space ﬂight arise despite estab- lished rules and guidelines22,23. A note on terminology: SpaceX, Axiom, and others refer to their travelers as ‘crew ’. This has important consequences since the limited Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines24that are applicable to non-professional astronauts are somewhat more stringent for crewthan ‘ordinary ’space ﬂight occupants. To bypass ambiguity, we prefer the term ‘space ﬂight occupants ’(SOs), using it to refer to non- professional space travelers lacking substantial space ﬂight training. Further, we use the terms ‘laws ’and ‘regulations ’to refer to binding law and the neutral terms ‘guidelines ’,‘recommendations ’,a n d ‘policy ’to refer to non-binding guiding instruments. Considerations on governmental vs. non- governmental space ﬂight Biological hazards of space ﬂight The selection of professional astronauts is highly regulated because space travel and habitation are demanding and dangerous. Currentspace missions to the ISS in Low Earth Orbit and future missionspushing the boundaries of human space exploration towards theMoon and Mars are characterized by exposure to space radiation, suchas galactic cosmic rays (GCR), solar particle events (SPE), and trappedradiation 25, changing gravity ﬁelds, acceleration/deceleration phenomena26, isolation, and con ﬁnement27in a hostile and closed environment28and, ﬁnally, the increasingly far distance from Earth (Fig. 1). Exposure to GCR/SPE is potentially the most signi ﬁcant single health hazard for Low Earth Orbit; for deep-space crewed missions beyond the Earth ’s protective magnetic ﬁeld this risk pro ﬁle increases dramatically28. Recently, NASA increased an individual astronaut ’st o t a l career effective radiation dose (independent of age at exposure andsex) due to space ﬂight radiation exposure to less than 600 mSv, translating into a mean risk increase of cancer mortality (REID) ofbelow 3% above the non-exposed baseline mean 21.T h i sc h a n g ew a s implemented following a study carried out under the auspices of theNational Academies of Sciences 29. However, these standards remain controversial, especially in light of predicted REID ranging between 6-10% for females exposed at ages 20, 40, and 60 years for a simulated Mars Mission 20. Of note, most international partners use a higher career dose limit of 1,000mSV (independent of sex and age). Health concerns and ethical considerations regarding commercial space travel are of great importance considering that the aforemen-tioned potential hazards can severely interfere with many physiologi-cal processes, such as physiological homeostasis on a cellular and DistanceConfinementHostile and closed  environments Changing  gravity fieldsGalactic cosmic rays Fig. 1 | The Five Hazards in Space Contributing to Increased Health Risks.

Furthermore, several space hazards cause DNA damage28,30,a f f e c t telomere length30, induce signi ﬁcant differences in DNA methylation, and alter accessibility of chromatin regions and speci ﬁc DNA epitopes30,34. Such cellular and molecular effects lead to serious pathophysiology and health consequences25, including but not limited to: changes in the cardiovascular system including ﬂuid shifts, ortho- static intolerance, reduced ventricle size, thrombus formation28,35–39, musculoskeletal defects de ﬁned as muscle atrophy and bone loss30,40–42, central nervous system alterations including ﬂuid shifts, neurocognitive and psychiatric alteration and Space-AssociatedNeuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) 43,44, immune system dysfunction, initiation of malignant processes45due to loss of DNA integrity, failed DNA repair mechanisms, mutations, and chromosomal rearrangements46. Nevertheless, while knowledge mounts, there remains a lack of data addressing individual differences amongastronauts, such as age, sex, and genetic background, contributing tothe challenges of accurately predicting radiation hazards andoutcomes 28. Ethical issues related to the dangers and selection of SOs Given these signi ﬁcant space ﬂight hazards, stringent selection criteria are important to protect astronaut and SO health and to help ensurethat missions can be completed successfully. For instance, the ISSMultilateral Space Medicine Board provides guidance about travel tothe ISS by private individuals 47,48and NASA has signi ﬁcantly strength- ened its health-oriented recommendations and guidelines over the last two decades. Similarly, independent organizations such as the Aero-space Medical Association, have issued policies and guidelines takinginto consideration not just the physical health of SOs but also theirmental health 49. There are not only expansive rules and guidelines atthe selection and annual re-evaluation stage for astronauts, but also stringent health monitoring before, during, and after space ﬂight50. However, with increasing commercial and private space ﬂight oppor- tunities, it is no longer just trained and pre-screened astronauts who travel to space. Since existing guidance in its various forms applies mostly to government-sponsored or -employed professional astro-nauts, the question arises as to who determines whether the potentialhealth risks associated with space ﬂight are acceptable or not in the case of SOs. Current guidance on its own is not in a good position to resolve some of the issues that will arise in these new contexts. Both medicaland scienti ﬁc research communities as well as a number of govern- ments have long and carefully deliberated about medical and ethicalscenarios and questions that might arise during space ﬂight. However, while some of their guidelines might apply to certain instances of, say, paying SOs (for example, private astronauts travelling to the ISS and therefore covered by ISS rules), there is still a relative dearth of dis-cussion concerning how to extend these important deliberations tot h en e wt y p e so fS Ot h a tw ea r el i k e l yt os e ei nt h ec o m i n gd e c a d e s . Moreover, since existing law and policy frameworks were designed mostly with government-employed or -sponsored astronautsin mind, their scope does not always extend neatly to their non-governmental counterparts. For instance, federal space agencies forman employer-employee relationship with their astronauts. While thismight be applicable to some kinds of potential commercial SOs, it willn o tb ea p p l i c a b l et op r i v a t eS O s .F o re x a m p l e ,w h i l et h eI n t e r n a t i o n a l Commission on Radiological Protection stresses the importance of radiological protection, in the U.S. the National Council on RadiationProtection and Measurements (NCRP) 51explicitly states that its pur- view is “NASA selection of astronauts for participation in space mis- sions ”and that “the measures suggested in this Report may be unique to NASA and not generalizable ”.A l t h o u g ht h er e ﬁnements proposed by the NCRP to NASA ’s shared decision-making framework do not directly pertain to commercial and private SOs, their relevance is evi-dent and should be taken into consideration. One might think that general documents of medical research ethics could provide some help here. For example, the World Medical Association ’s( W M A ) “Declaration of Helsinki ”(DoH) 52is one of the most in ﬂuential and important sets of ethical principles concerning medical research involving human subjects. While the WMA has noformal authority or binding status, it is still often expected thatguidelines concerning research ethics will look to the DoH as a guidingdocument. However, the DoH is neither accepted by all countries noruncontroversial. For example, Schüklenk and Ashcroft 53have high- lighted both the “absence of a consensus over the actual content of the Declaration and its status ”, and stressed its “continuing lack of a ser- ious consultation with the relevant stakeholders ”, while also empha- s i z i n gt h em o r eg e n e r a l “absence of a consensus among knowledgeable, well-intentioned bioethicists, scientists and political activists over the central issue of research ethics standards ”.T h e r ei s also a heated debate about whether there exists an internationalconsensus opinion that violates and diverges from the DoH ’s principles 54,55. Macklin has argued that, even with revisions, the DoH “cannot resolve ongoing controversies ”, since “it simply does not address other aspects of international research about which peopledisagree ” 56. Macklin has further stressed con ﬂicts between the DoH and “ofﬁcial regulations promulgated by a federal agency, with enforcement mechanisms and sanctions for noncompliance ”and pointed out that “it is hardly surprising that researchers, ethical review bodies, and governmental agencies do not consider the Declaration of Helsinki to be a necessary adjunct to the “ofﬁcial”Common Rule, which governs most federally funded research in the United States ”56.I n d e e d , the US FDA ﬁrst rejected the 2000 and later revisions, before elim- inating all references to the DoH in 200657. The situation is not dis- similar in many other countries and regions.

Such features will have the potential to induce pathophysiologic system changes affecting the central nervous system, the cardiovascular system, immune functions, musculoskeletal dynamics, the circadian rhythm, and cancerrisk in SOs.Perspective https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-44357-x Nature Communications |         (2024) 15:4774 3 DoH –regardless of its controversies –are much too general to resolve particular ethical conundrums related to human space travel. Thus,while they might provide some necessary restrictions and sometimeseven positive guidance, the question of how such general principles apply to speci ﬁc and concrete cases, especially when there is little precedent, requires further examination. This of course is just onereason why agencies around the world spend enormous efforts oncrafting guidelines and recommendations about the ethics of humansubject research in space. But who will do the same for those spacetravelers to whom these do not apply? The relevant international legal framework, i.e. the ﬁve UN Space Treaties, do not speci ﬁcally address the health of astronauts or other space ﬂight participants 6. The Outer Space Treaty (OST) of 1967 introduces the concept of “envoys of mankind ”for astronauts58;t h e Rescue and Return Agreement (RRA) extends this protection to “per- sonnel of spacecraft ”. However, neither of these terms is clearly deﬁned and terminological inconsistencies have led to a broad inter- pretation, suggesting that the Agreement extends to human life inouter space or space ﬂight generally, covering both professional and non-professional space travelers, including tourists. However, theseagreements were drafted at a time when activities such as spacetourism were unforeseen, posing challenges in predicting and reg-ulating health concerns for modern space activities. Thus, theseagreements lack explicit health regulations for individuals that are partof the private space industry and, even if such regulations existed,enforcing them would be challenging due to the absence of robust enforcement mechanisms in international law. To address issues such as these at the US-level, the FAA 59and NASA entered a Memorandum of Understanding in June 2012, tocoordinate standards for commercial government or non-governmentastronaut transport to and from Low Earth Orbit and the ISS. The goalwas to foster both public and crew safety, avoid con ﬂicting rules and guidelines, as well as to provide a framework for the American spaceindustry. Despite this, the clearance of ‘ordinary ’SOs for space ﬂight is currently the responsibility of commercial providers, with limitedoversight, and a lack of standardized screening procedures andprotocols 60. The US is currently the main country providing such guidance in the form of the FAA Recommended Practices for HumanSpace Flight Occupant Safety . However, due to the limits of FAA jur- isdiction, these guidelines only apply to launch and reentry61.F u r t h e r , the FAA guidance comes not in the form of mandatory requirementsbut rather as (minimal) recommendations, suggesting merely that “[p] roximate to ﬂight, the operator should require each space ﬂight par- ticipant to consult with a physician, trained or experienced in aero-space medicine, to ascertain their personal medical risks from thespace ﬂight pro ﬁle and vehicle ”(2023: B. 4.4.2). It also explicitly states that “[t]his document does not include any speci ﬁc medical criteria that would limit who should ﬂy in space as a space ﬂight participant. ” (2023: A. 6.1). Thus, given that medical consultation is only a recom-mendation, in principle anyone capable of giving written informedconsent can ﬂy, regardless of their health pro ﬁl e ,a sl o n ga st h e ym e e t speci ﬁed space ﬂight operator criteria (Fig. 3). This raises a number of issues. First, if an SO fails to be cleared by one physician, can they get clearance from a more lenient provider elsewhere? 62As Langston points out, “[m]edical forum shopping is a foreseeable ethical and legal concern where regulatory standardization is lacking or is inconsistentbetween jurisdictions …[which] could lead to increased risk of harm for the individual (in- ﬂight/post- ﬂight), space ﬂight and crew, as well as uninvolved third parties ” 63. This scenario parallels a situation seen in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration64, where a disquali ﬁed driver can apply for a resolution if a disagreement exists in regard tothe medical quali ﬁcation exam. However, to oversee potential medical forum shopping, all results from medical examinations have to be entered into the centralized Natio nal Registry, preventing the con- tinued medical examination until a desired result is achieved andcertiﬁed. Second, there might be tension between the potential clearance requirements desirable for a commercial space ﬂight operator or pro- vider –who might have an interest in lenient requirements to sell as many seats as possible to the limited pool of individuals who can affordthem –and those desirable from the health standpoint of a particular SO. One might argue that SOs should undergo relevant medical con-sultations and decide on the risks they are willing to take, similar tomaking choices about risky adventures on Earth. So why should they not be in a position to make similar decisions for space? Nonetheless, Variable Health Status Stringent astronaut  selection criteria as defined  by NASA / ESA / JAXALess defined selection  criteria for commercial  space travelers Stringent government-driven selection criteria vs. minimal oversight for private SOs  Established policies and ethical guidelines vs. lack of comprehensive regulations Regulatory framework for astronaut health vs. uncertainties and inconsistencies in SOs' health assessments Fig. 3 | Differential Approaches to Selecting SOs. Stringent selection criteria (green) for government-sponsored astronauts (i.e., NASA, ESA, JAXA), including a hard stop mechanism are depicted on the right of the schematic (right dashed redline). Less de ﬁned commercial space traveler criteria for civilians (red) ﬁnallyleading to rejection (left dashed red line) are indicated. The green-red color-coded middle area symbolizes the health-related risks, where the array of potential commercial space selection criteria is located.Perspective https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-44357-x Nature Communications |         (2024) 15:4774 4 while legal and social norms allow people to engage in some risks, the same norms do not give blanket allowance for people to do anythingthey want, instead exercising various degrees of paternalistic oversightboth in people ’s private and public lives (for an overview of paternal- ism and its issues, see Dworkin 2020) 65. For example, many govern- ments require drivers and passengers to wear seatbelts, they requiremotorcyclists to wear helmets, forbid the sale of certain drugs, theyforbid people to enter into certain kinds of contracts (for sellingorgans, gambling debts, etc.). Questions thus arise about the appro-priate degree of paternalistic oversight for space travel, as well asquestions about who has the power to enforce relevant policies andregulations. A further complication –and again one that speaks in favor of increased guidance or regulation –is that compromised SO health might also affect fellow passengers. In fact, the September 2023revisions of the FAA recommendations now recognize this problem at least partially, stating that “[m]edical consultation for space ﬂight participants is recommended …t oh e l pp r e v e n tt h e mf r o me n d a n - gering other occupants …. [and] commercial operators will be chal- lenged to control hazards to space ﬂight participants from other space ﬂight participants with medical conditions. ” 61This is, of course, also a problem with respect to various forms of ground and air transporta-tion; however, it is exacerbated in the case of space travel. For one,providing assistance in space is more dif ﬁcult than on the ground or in the air, thus putting fellow travelers in a position in which they aremore likely to compromise their own safety during the course ofproviding help, especially in the absence of mandatory training. Fur- ther, space travel has inherent limits about the amount and kind of medical equipment that can be transported and effectively used in aspace ﬂight environment. Third, even if stringent screening requirements are in place, substantial uncertainties remain regarding the various health con-sequences of space travel, making it virtually impossible for speci ﬁc individuals to understand what their actual health risks are, even ifadvised by someone “trained or experienced in aerospace medicine ” 61. Current data insuf ﬁciently address individual differences among astronauts such as age, sex, and genetic background66, which trans- lates into signi ﬁcant uncertainty in predicting individualized space radiation hazards and outcomes for both astronauts and SOs67.I n addition, while it is known that individuals metabolize drugs andsupplements differently in space 68–70, little to nothing is known about the physiology underlying these changes. Limited available data70 suggests that even relatively common prescription drugs might workdifferently in space. Furthermore, the reduced and often unknownstability of pharmacologic ingredients and supplements over thecourse of exploration-rated space missions becomes even morecritical 70. Specially prepared space medications, appropriate repacka- ging to improve pharmaceutical stability, and more insight into indi-vidual pharmacokinetics are needed to supply both astronauts and SOs with effective pharmaceuticals and/or other treatment options. All of these considerations strongly suggest that some guidance and/or oversight with respect to potential SO screening and clearancewould be highly bene ﬁcial (Fig. 3). In fact, this is not just so for the SOs, but also for the commercial providers who agree to transport them.While SOs are currently required to sign liability waivers, the legalstatus of these waivers is unclear, and so binding rules might alsoprovide a way for providers to indemnify themselves against futurelawsuits 71. However, such rules should be sensitive to the diversity and variety of potential space ﬂight endeavors: there is a difference between a private citizen enjoying a suborbital ﬂight and a commercial crew member spending prolonged time in space for research pur- poses, perhaps on a commercial space station. Human subject research As our technical and research abilities evolve, so do the ethical con- siderations for using human subjects for research. While NASAestimated the chance of survival of the ﬁrst mission to the Moon (Apollo 8) at 50-50, such odds for harm would not be accepted for anypresent-day study involving human subjects (recollection quoted fromRef. 72). NASA ’s ethical principles are de ﬁned to ensure human research subject welfare and minimize health risks. Further, research protocols can be implemented only if a risk/bene ﬁt analysis demon- strates that the risks to the subjects are reasonable in relation to theanticipated bene ﬁts and the expected importance of new knowledge. This will become even more important for missions to Mars 73.I n addition to the prevention of direct harm, other important con-siderations include protecting privacy, ensuring strict data security,and maximizing the positive social impacts of research. Human Subject Research projects in space, supported or other- wise subject to regulation by any US federal department or agency, arestrictly regulated under the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR pt 123069). Based on this, the implementation, procedures, and requirements to conduct space-related research involving humansubjects is tightly controlled within a binding framework. NASA Insti-tutional Review Board (IRB) committees review such research propo-sals to guarantee enforcement of th ese policies and the ethical, safe, and equitable treatment of human research subjects. In addition, theOfﬁce of Research Assurance ensures that all activities comply with applicable federal regulations and guidelines, ensuring that humansubject welfare and minimal health risk are prioritized for all decisions.Such analysis will not take into account potential long-term effects onpublic policies. An interesting variation from non-NASA research pro- tocols is the requirement that the responsible ﬂight surgeon maintains the duty to intervene and terminate ongoing research if the health andwelfare of astronaut research subjects is in question. While the NASA IRB process adheres to standard practices for IRBs, it has unique aspects focused on human subjects ’well-being beyond typical standards. The highest level of concern involves humansubject research studies involving genetic testing. NASA de ﬁnes genetic testing based on the Genetic Information NondiscriminationAct 74. Studies involving genetic testing in human subjects are deemed of the highest concern and automatically categorized as “greater than minimal risk ”,a c c o r d i n gt oN A S A75. These studies require additional measures to protect the research subjects, including policies that prohibit the public release of genetic data without prior approval fromthe individual or their direct family members, in accordance with NASApolicy. NASA enforces strict rules as genetic data must be storedseparately, and cross-referencing is forbidden without IRB approval.After genetic testing, all electronic data is deleted and given solely toNASA. However, commercial institutions or providers using services atNASA facilities to launch a space vehicle do not have to adhere to suchrules in the same way. While the above-described scenarios are focused on NASA, the processes for international ISS partner research are not demon- strating signi ﬁcant national differences. In general, plans for research involving human research subjects are carefully examined by theethics committee of the researcher ’s university or institute, the space agency proposing the research, and the space agency of the astro-naut subject. Furthermore, the Human Research Multilateral ReviewBoard (HRMRB), comprising the representatives of space agenciesinvolved in the ISS (NASA, ESA, CSA, JAXA), is tasked with investi-gating and reviewing ethical matters on the ISS. For all researchconducted on an astronaut, the HRMRB looks at whether the safetyand health of the astronaut are assured and whether the appropriateethical considerations have been made. As necessary, the HRMRBthen issues recommendations or modi ﬁcation requests. While government-sponsored human subject research is strictly regulated, it is still unclear whether future commercial SOs will be coveredunder such regulations, or if adherence to government regulationsneeds to be amended to re ﬂect the new reality of space human subject research.Perspective https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-44357-x Nature Communications |         (2024) 15:4774 5 Ethical considerations To date, our knowledge regarding the effects of space ﬂight on humans, as well as the ef ﬁcacy and safety of select medical interven- tions and pharmaceuticals in space, comes from government-sponsored missions, a small number of astronauts, and, morerecently, civilians (Inspiration4, MS-20, Axiom-1) 76,77.I n c r e a s i n gt h i s type of knowledge is vital to ensuring the safety of future astronautsand SOs, especially considering the limited opportunities for medicaltreatment in space. It is therefore likely that astronauts and SOs willneed to monitor, diagnose, and treat themselves at least part of thetime. Increased commercial and private space ﬂight opportunities will bring with them an expanding diversity of SOs with different health proﬁles, most of them likely not in the same physical and psychological shape as highly trained career astronauts 78–80.B yn e c e s s i t y ,i n c r e a s i n g knowledge about the effects of the space ﬂight environment on human molecular biology, physiology, and psychology, as well as on thechemical composition of pharmaceuticals, involves human subjectresearch. With the success of the recent Inspiration4 mission indeﬁning a wide range of biomedical data, the role of commercial and private SOs in such research is likely to increase. As previously outlined, government-sponsored space ﬂights adhere to stringent criteria with respect to human subject research,through their respective IRBs, eth ics committees, and groups. In the case of Inspiration4, research was conducted through Weill Cornell Medicine, the Translational Research Institute for Space Health of the Baylor College of Medicine 81, California Institute of Technology, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology and underwent similarly rig-orous approval processes 82. As the general standard for human subject research requires compliance with ethics approvals, it is expected thatcommercial space ﬂight-based human subject research will continue to follow these and other applicable internationally rati ﬁed pro- cesses (Fig. 4). However, commercial space ﬂight also raises new ethical issues. In the past, human subject research in space was mostly a secondaryconcern of overall missions whereas now missions are increasinglyconducted explicitly for this purpose. Ethical recruitment for biome-dical research requires informed consent. For space travel,this requires participants to have a good understanding of the spaceenvironment, the nature of associated environmental hazards, as wellas the potential side effects of any drugs under study 51.B u tt ow h a t extent is such consent really possible with respect to space travel?83 Exposure to high radiation, microgravity, and galactic rays may com-promise participant safety in a number of unknown ways. Further, theeffect of radiation and other extra-terrestrial factors on the chemicalcomposition of pharmaceutical ingredients is largely unknown, thusmaking it especially dif ﬁcult to inform potential subjects about likely side effects. The US Code of Regulations for informed consent requiresa“description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject ”(Title 45, A.A. Part 46.116, b2 82). In the case of space travel, where many or most risks are unknown, it is unclear to what extent –if at all –this requirement can be met. Thus, there is a need to incor- porate new and emerging ethical issues into existing frameworks inways that are based on the same underlying ethical principles that gave rise to these and similar regulations in the ﬁrst place and that are applicable to space travel. This is all the more urgent since civilians arealready involved in such research 51. Note also that the aforementioned problems are exacerbated for non-astronaut SOs: most of the existingdata is not from a random population, but rather from an elite force Fig. 4 | Human Subject Research Ethical and Operational Guidelines. As c h e - matic for the ethical framework for space human subject research. This frameworkdeﬁnes the key existing principles and regulations that currently exist in humanresearch (in blue), the implementation of these ethical standards in the clinic and research laboratory (in yellow), and the challenges that should be considered andwill arise for human research in space (in orange).Perspective https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-44357-x Nature Communications |         (2024) 15:4774 6 markedly dissimilar to average citizens in terms of training, age, health, and biomedical and behavioral pro ﬁles. Additionally, it has been established that even highly trained individuals respond quite differ-ently to the zero-gravity environment 84. Moreover, existing research was conducted on a population with a high degree of sex, gender, and ethnic homogeneity and relatively low diversity. Currently, it istherefore unclear to what extent this research generalizes to SOsbeyond the relatively narrow population that has been studied so far. Furthermore, principles of health ethics encompass avoiding harm, bene ﬁcence, achieving a favorable risk-bene ﬁt balance, respecting autonomy, fairness, and ﬁdelity 85. Terrestrial clinical trials rely on large participant numbers, secure drug storage, and timelysample collection, which are dif ﬁcult to replicate in space. How to ensure compliance with these principles in space thus remainsuncertain. There are also some concerns about individual principles: For example, human subject research in space may violate a partici- pant ’s autonomy, should the individual decide to withdraw from the study. In terrestrial medical research, subjects may at any time with-draw their consent, even if the study is already in progress. Suchwithdrawal, however, is much more complicated in space. Even ifindividuals are able to drop out, return to Earth will not be immediate.There is also no way for individuals to withdraw from the possible(unknown) long-term effects of the space ﬂight environment, and any consent thus involves not just consent to the study itself, but consentto any future effects that might result from space ﬂight activities. This might also lead to violating the Avoiding Harm principle, since remaining in space is unhealthy for participants, especially if the desired withdrawal occurs as the result of unforeseen health problems.In turn, these conditions might then violate the Favorable Risk andBene ﬁt Balance, due to the changing circumstances during the course of research. In NASA ’s case, the responsible ﬂight surgeon can inter- rupt trials. However, in the absence of of ﬁcial, government-sanctioned ﬂight surgeons with extensive space ﬂight experience, who assumes the equivalent responsibilities for SO healthcare, ensuring subjects ’ best interests are met? These problems represent only a small subset of issues, demon- strating the urgent need for guidance on non-government space research on human subjects (for further issues relating to privacy and behavioral health, see 86,87). Such research should follow strict ethics committee review and otherwise meet the same stringent standardst h a tN A S A ,E S A ,a n dJ A X Ac u r r e n t l ya d h e r et o 88, including following suggestions by international medical research bodies, such as the DoH,The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences ’ International Ethical Guidelines for Health-Related Research InvolvingHumans 89, and others. Conclusion We are entering an exciting new era of space exploration previously only thought of as science ﬁction. Commercial/private and civilian space ﬂights, such as Inspiration4 and the Polaris missions are no longer just a possibility but a reality. Exciting as these opportunitiesare, they also come with the burden of ensuring that future spacetravel will be as safe and ethical as possible. While governmentaloversight has historically governed space activities, the emergence ofnon-governmental initiatives calls for uni ﬁed ethical guidelines, safe- guarding human well-being during selection, research, and decision-making in space. Since non-governmental out ﬁts are not bound by the same rules in the same way, we as a community must ensure that theguidelines we set will guide space exploration according to the highestethical and medical standards for humans that are currently possible, including selection of SOs, medical research ranging from human subject research to discussion of in- ﬂight triage decisions. The added difﬁculties of non-universal terminology referring to different kinds of space travelers and of making guidelines sensitive to the diversity andvariety of potential space ﬂight endeavors will add further layers ofcomplexity. The earlier and better any such guidelines can be imple- mented, the better the chances that space travel can be performedaccording to the safest and most optimal standards. References 1.

Weidentify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1 )e n c o d i n ga nE T H Y L E N E - INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative genefor the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2(OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls theproduction of reactive oxygen species i n the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localizatio n of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentlemechanical resistance to root tips, inc luding growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosen sing-induced calcium signaling is required and suf ﬁcient for antagonizing the eth ylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unantici pated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism. The terrestrial colonization of plants is a critical milestone in the Earth ’s evolution history, dramatically increasing the productivity of organic carbon on land to support highly diverse ecosystems1,2.T h e emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a criticalevolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the soil andabsorb water and nutrients 3. Root gravitropism features perception of gravity by the root cap and directional growth regulation mediated byauxin 4. In gravity-oriented roots, symmetrical distribution of auxin in root tips maintain symmetrical growth5. When root growth deviates from the direction of gravity, the amyloplasts in the columella cells ofthe root cap rapidly sink to the plasma membrane at the bottom,triggering the activation of gravity response via LAZY proteins 6,7.S u c h response entails relocation of the auxin exporter PIN-FORMED (PIN) inthe cells and redistribution of auxin8–10, thus promoting asymmetric auxin ﬂow and asymmetric cell growth to bend the root tip to the gravity direction11. Mutations in auxin transporters and gravity- signaling-related proteins often lead to defective root gravitropismduring vertical growth, such as root tips growing toward randomdirections 7,12,13,w a v yr o o t s14, and enlarged root angles15,16. The gaseous plant hormone ethylene plays crucial roles in plant development, senescence, and stress resistance17,18.E t h y l e n eb i o - synthesis and signaling are induced by speci ﬁc conditions or stresses, including ﬂooding, drought, low temperatures, and pathogens18.

When the stress signal fades and the ethylene level goes down, EIN3/EILs are degraded by the EIN3-BINDING F-box protein 1/2 (EBF1/2) mediated ubiquitination/ proteasome pathway27,28. Although ethylene is indispensable for plants, high level of ethy- lene is adverse for root growth29. In compacted soil, diffusion of ethylene away from roots is limited, resulting in the accumulation ofethylene and inhibition of root penetration into the soil 30.E t h y l e n e inhibits root elongation by interacting with other plant hormones,such as auxin and abscisic acid 31. For example, excess ethylene enhances auxin biosynthesis and promotes Auxin Response Factors(ARFs)-mediated transcriptional regulation to affect cell wall compo-sition, thereby limiting the elongation of root cells 32,33. Excess ethylene also weakens root gravitropic response by affecting auxin biosynthesis34,35. In addition, some auxin signaling and transport mutants exhibit both defective gravitropic phenotypes and insensi-tivity to ethylene 36,37. However, the speci ﬁc mechanism whereby ethylene signaling controls gravitropic growth remains unclear. In this study, we isolated an intriguing rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponic culture but normal gravitropic growth insoil. The mutated gene represents a loss-of-function allele for the EIN3-binding F-box protein OsCRW1/OsEBF1, leading to overaccumulationof the OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and ampli ﬁed ethylene signaling. We show that OsEIL1/2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82, which subsequently regulates the transcription of several genes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overaccumulation ofROS in the root tip leads to premature loss of the root cap structure,impaired polar localization of OsPIN2 and auxin distribution, resultingin severely impaired gravitropism. In the soil-grown plants, however,gravitropism is restored in a mechanosensing-induced calciumsignaling-dependent manner, revealing an intricate regulation ofgravitropism by crosstalk between ethylene signaling andmechanosensing. Results crw1 roots coil in water but not in soil We screened an ethyl methylsulfonate-mutagenized population (approximately 5000 lines) of the rice ( Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Zhonghua11 and isolated a mutant with root coiling phenotype wheng r o w ni nh y d r o p o n i cc u l t u r e( F i g . 1a, Supplementary Movie 1). Both seminal and adventitious roots of the mutant coiled in the root tipregion, resulting in a shorter root depth compared to the wild type(WT, Supplementary Fig. 1). Changes in nutrient supply, solution pH,aeration (dissolved oxygen level), and exposure to light did not alterthe root coiling phenotype of the mutant in hydroponic culture(Supplementary Fig. 2). When grown in water-saturated solid media (e.g. paddy soil, soil-vermiculite mixture, vermiculite and peat pellet), however, the root coiling phenotype disappeared (Fig. 1aa n dS u p - plementary Fig. 3). We named the mutant coiling root in water (crw1). In contrast to the distinctive root phenotype, shoots of crw1 grew normally in hydroponics (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Plants were grownto maturity in two paddy ﬁelds. In one paddy ﬁeld, no signi ﬁcant dif- ference was observed between crw1 and WT in any of the agronomic traits determined at plant maturity (Supplementary Fig. 4c –h), whereas in the other ﬁeld there was a small and signi ﬁcant reduction in the percentage of ﬁlled grains and grain biomass per plant in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 4i –n). crw1 exhibits smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and defective gravitropic response in hydroponic T h ec o i l i n gp h e n o t y p eo f crw1 suggests that it may be a gravitropic mutant. Compared with WT, crw1 had a smaller root cap (Fig. 1b) and fewer amyloplasts in the root tip (Fig. 1c). When roots were placedhorizontally, crw1 responded less sensitively to gravity than WT and started to coil at 6 h after horizontal placement (Fig. 1d, e and Sup- plementary Fig. 5), indicating impaired gravitropic response. Auxin distribution is crucial for root gravitropism11.T oe x a m i n e the auxin distribution in the root tip, we introduced the auxin reporter DR5rev::VENUS into WT and crw1. When grown in water (Fig. 1g), WT roots showed symmetrical auxin distribution, whereas crw1 showed asymmetric auxin distribution at different stages of coiling (Fig. 1g). When WT roots were placed horizontally, gravity triggered rapidaccumulation of auxin on the bottom side of the root tip, causing it togrow towards the gravity direction; once the root tip grew in thegravity direction, symmetrical auxin distribution was restored (Sup-plementary Fig. 6a). In contrast, crw1 exhibited an asymmetric auxin distribution at all stages under gravitational stimulation (Supplemen-tary Fig. 6b). As expected, asymmetric auxin distribution led to asymmetric cell length on the two sides of the root tip (Supplementary Fig. 7a –c). Compared to WT, crw1 had a shorter meristem and fewer meristem cells (Supplementary Fig. 7d, e). Staining with 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) showed a lower proliferation of meristem cells incrw1 than WT (Supplementary Fig. 7f, g). Applying the auxin bio- synthesis inhibitor L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn) or removing the root capresulted in a more even auxin distribution (indicated by DR5rev::VE- NUS) and rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplemen- tary Fig. 8). InArabidopsis thaliana , symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip is maintained by the auxin exporter PIN2, which is polarly localized on the top of the root epidermal cells to allow the shootward ﬂow of auxin from the root tip 12. This pattern of polar localization is conserved in seed plants3. To examine the localization of OsPIN2 in the root tip, we introduced OsPIN2-GFP driven by its native promoter ( pOsPI- N2::OsPIN2-GFP )i n t oW Ta n d crw1 by crossing. OsPIN2-GFP was polarly localized in the epidermal cells in WT, whereas such polarity was lost incrw1 (Fig. 1h), which is consistent with the asymmetric auxin dis- tribution observed in crw1 root tips. When grown in soil, all phenotypes of the mutant, including root coiling, root cap size, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, andgravity response, were rescued to similar levels observed in WT (Fig. 1a–h and Supplementary Fig. 5). Taken together, these data sug- gest that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water is caused by a smaller root cap size with fewer amyloplasts and asymmetric auxindistribution resulted from OsPIN2 mis-localization. Cloning the causative gene of crw1 To clone the causal gene for the crw1 phenotype, we backcrossed WT (paternal) with crw1 (maternal). All F 1plants showed the straight-root phenotype in water (Supplementary Fig. 9a), and the F 2progeny seg- regated into 340 and 119 straight and coiling-root, respectively, whichis consistent with a 3:1 ratio ( χ 2= 0.002, P= 0.966) (Supplementary Fig. 9b), indicating that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 resulted from recessive mutation of a single gene. We conducted genomicresequencing mapping and Mut-Map analysis on the F 2progeny and identi ﬁed three candidate genes, Os06g0604400 ,Os06g0605900 , and Os06g0619600 (Supplementary Fig. 9c, d). Complementation tests identi ﬁedOs06g0605900 as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype, which we name COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (OsCRW1) (Fig. 2a–d and Supplementary Fig. 9e, f). Compared to WT, a 3681-bp fragment deletion was identi ﬁed in the promoter and a portion of the open reading frame of crw1 allele, resulting in a total loss of tran- scription (Fig. 2a, b). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of OsCRW1 (oscrw1KO) in WT also generated the same root coiling phenotype in water, which disappeared in soil (Fig. 2e, f and Supplementary Fig. 10a). The three oscrw1KOlines also showed smaller root caps and asymmetric auxin distribution in the root tips when grown in water, and thesedefective phenotypes were rescued when plants were grown in soil(Supplementary Fig. 10b, c).Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Nature Communications |         (2025) 16:3712 2 Analysis of transgenic plants expressing pOsCRW1::GFP and pOsCRW1::GUS showed that OsCRW1 was expressed in both roots and shoots (Fig. 2g ,ha n dS u p p l e m e n t a r yF i g .1 1 ) .I nr o o t s , OsCRW1 was strongly expressed in root tips, especially in the root cap (Fig. 2g, h).

To examine whether loss of function of OsEBF2 affects gravitropism, we knocked out OsEBF2 in the WT background using CRISPR/Cas9. No effect on root growth and gravitropism wasfound (Supplementary Fig. 12a, b). Knockout of OsEBF2 incrw1 did not exacerbate the root coiling phenotype in water, and also did not affectthe phenotype recovery in soil (Supplementary Fig. 12c, d), suggestingthat OsEBF2, unlike OsCRW1/OsEBF1, does not play a role in rootgravitropism. We performed RNA-seq analysis on WT and crw1 roots grown in water or soil. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs)between crw1 and WT grown in water, ethylene-responsive genes were strongly enriched, with 30 of the 32 DEGs being signi ﬁcantly upregu- lated in crw1, including 20 ethylene response transcription factors (ERFs) (Fig. 3a, b). When grown in soil, the number of DEGs between crw1 and WT decreased to 5, with 2 ethylene-related genes being upregulated in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 13). Application of 1-MCP, an ethylene response inhibitor, totally rescuedthe phenotypes of smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution androot coiling in crw1 and three oscrw1 KOlines in water (Fig. 3c–f), sug- gesting that excessive ethylene response leads to the root coiling phenotype. The above ﬁndings support the notion that OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may, likeArabidopsis AtEBF1, function in the degradation of core ethylene response transcription factors27,28. These may include OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that are rice homologs of AtEIN3/EIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 14a),the central transcriptional factors controlling the activation of ethy-lene signaling and targets of AtEBF1 41,42. We investigated whether OsCRW1 interacts with OsEIL1/OsEIL2 proteins. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H)and bimolecular ﬂuorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that OsCRW1 physically interacted with OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 (Supple-mentary Fig. 14b, c). We generated transgenic plants expressingpOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag orpOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag in WT, and introduced these transgenes into crw1 by crossing. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated much higher levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 than WTwhen grown in water, but the differences largely disappeared wheng r o w ni ns o i l( F i g . 4a, b).

In contrast, WT roots grown in a highly compactedsoil (bulk density = 1.6 g cm −3) exhibited an elevated level of OsEIL1, indicating an increased ethylene consistent with the report by Pandey et al.30Next, we knocked out OsEIL1 (oseil1KO/crw1 )o rOsEIL2 (oseil2KO/ crw1)i ncrw1 by using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplementary Fig. 14d, e), which essentially rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water (Fig. 4c, d), with the effect being greater in oseil1KO/crw1 than in oseil2KO/crw1 . These results indicate that loss of function of OsCRW1/ OsEBF1 leads to overaccumulation of both OsEIL1 and OsEIL2, causingthe root coiling phenotype in water, with OsEIL1 playing a larger rolethan OsEIL2. Next, we overexpressed OsEIL1 orOsEIL2 driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter, increasing the transcription of the two genes by 16-22- and 52-57-fold, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 16a, b). When grown in water, OsEIL1 andOsEIL2 overexpressing lines showed shorter and slightly curved roots compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 16c).Addition of a small dose of the ethylene precursor ACC (1 μM) in water decreased root growth of WT slightly but caused OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines to coil in the root tip region, a phenotyperesembling crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 16d). Overexpression of OsEIL1 orOsEIL2 alone did not cause root coiling, likely because OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 is degraded in the presence of functional OsCRW1/OsEBF1. Incontrast, enhanced ethylene concentration from ACC addition mayrepress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and thus stabilize OsEIL1and OsEIL2 proteins, as has been shown in Arabidopsis 43.W h e ng r o w n in soil, the shorter and curvy roots of OsEIL1 andOsEIL2 overexpressing lines were largely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 16e). OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82 To search for the direct target genes downstream of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2that cause root coiling in crw1, we analyzed the expression pattern of all of the 139 ERFgenes from the transcriptomic data. We expected that the transcriptional levels of the target genes should match the phe-notype changes, i.e. elevated in crw1 only in water but reduced in soil. When grown in water, 20 ERFgenes were expressed at higher levels in crw1 roots than WT (Supplementary Fig. 17a). When grown in soil, 17 of these 20 ERFgenes were equally highly expressed in both WT and crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 17b), suggesting that these 17 ERFgenes may not be related to the root coiling phenotype of crw1. The three remaining ERFgenes, OsERF2 (Os06g0181700 ),OsERF81 (Os02g0520000 )a n d OsERF82 (Os04g0399800 )w e r es i g n i ﬁcantly downregulated in both WT and crw1 when grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 17b). These ERF genes are potential candidate genes targeted by OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 andassociated with the occurrence of the root coiling phenotype (Sup-plementary Fig. 17b, c and Fig. 4e). We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the three ERF genes individually in the crw1 background (Supple- mentary Fig. 17d –f) and found that disruption of OsERF82 (oserf82 KO/ crw1) rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water to a large extent (Fig. 4f, g), whereas knockout of OsERF2 orOsERF81 had no effect (Supplementary Fig. 17g, h). The OsERF82 protein was localizedin the nucleus and exhibited transactivation activity (SupplementaryFig. 18a, b). We used yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoreticmobility shift assay (EMSA) to demonstrate that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2could speci ﬁcally bind to the EIN3-binding sites (EBS, ATGTA) in the promoter region (2.5 Kb) of OsERF82 (Fig. 4h–j and Supplementary Fig. 18c). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR of pOsEIL1::O- sEIL1-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 transgenic plants showed that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 bound to the EBS sequences in theOsERF82 promoter in vivo (Fig. 4k, l). Furthermore, knockout of OsEIL1 orOsEIL2 incrw1 largely abolished the upregulation of OsERF82 expression when grown in water (Fig. 4m). Taken together, the tran- scription factor OsERF82 acts as a direct target of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 toamplify ethylene signaling and cause root coiling of crw1 in water.T h ec o m p l e t er e s c u eo ft h e crw1 phenotype in oseil1/crw1 but the incomplete rescue in oserf82 KO/crw1 suggests that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also be involved. OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS nexus controls gravitropism In addition to the ethylene signaling pathway, RNA-seq showed thatgenes related to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were alsoenriched in crw1 when grown in water but not in soil (Fig. 3aa n d Supplementary Fig. 19a), suggesting that ROS may be involved in theroot coiling phenotype. Among the DEGs between crw1 and WT, a ROS- responsive gene Bsr-d1/ZFP36 , a respiratory burst oxidase homolog enzyme gene ( RBOHH ) and four class III peroxidase genes were upre- gulated in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 19b). It has been shown OsRBOHH is involved in ROS production in rice roots 44. The Class III peroxidases are also possibly involved in ROS production in multiple and func- tionally redundant ways45. To examine whether ROS is involved in the root coiling phenotype, we used the ROS ﬂuorescent probe H 2DCFDA to monitor root ROS levels in WT and crw1 grown in water. Compared with WT, the ROS level in the root tips of crw1 was elevated dramati- cally, especially in the coiling region and the sloughing root cap cells(Fig. 5a). Aeration of hydroponic solution had no effect on the ROS level in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 20). When grown in soil or vermi- culite, ROS in crw1 roots returned to a low level comparable to that in WT, corresponding to the recovery of the root phenotype (Supple-mentary Fig. 19c, d). Increased programmed cell death was observed inthe root cap cells of crw1 grown in water by the TUNEL assay (Fig. 5b), which was likely induced by excess ROS 46and explained why crw1 had a smaller root cap than WT. Application of the ROS scavengerN-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), the RBOH inhibitor diphenyleneio- donium (DPI, 50 nM), or the inhibitor of the class III peroxidase sali-cylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) in water reduced ROS in crw1 roots to the level comparable to that in WT (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 19e, f), prevented the excessive programmed cell death andsloughing of the root cap cells, and largely rescued the root coilingphenotype (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 19g, h). Furthermore, clearance of ROS restored the polar localization of OsPIN2 and sym-metric distribution of auxin in the root tips of crw1 (Fig. 5d, e). Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced ROS generation, likely by RBOHs and PRXs, causes root coiling in crw1 by accelerating sloughing of root cap cells and impairing OsPIN2 localization. To establish the causal relationship between excess ROS and the ampli ﬁed OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 roots, we grew WT, crw1, oseil1 KO/crw1 lines, oseil2KO/crw1 lines, and oserf82KO/crw1 lines in water and examined the ROS level in root tips. Knockout of OsEIL1 ,OsEIL2 ,o r OsERF82 incrw1 decreased ROS to a similar level as in WT (Fig. 5f–h), suggesting that the ampli ﬁed OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 leads to excessive ROS generation in the root tip. To explore howenhanced OsERF82 promotes ROS production, we found that the promoter regions (approximately 3 Kb) of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Os09g0323700, Os06g06 95400 and Os07g0638600) contain potential ERF binding sites, including DRE/CRT (GCCGAC),GCC-box (GCCGCC) and G-box (CACGTG) 47(Supplementary Fig. 21a). The Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay(EMSA) demonstrated that OsERF82 speci ﬁcally bound to the binding sites of the DRE/CRT, GCC-box and G-box in the promoter region ofOsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the transcriptional levels of OsRBOHH and the three Class III OsPRX genes were upregulated in crw1 root tips compared with those in WT (Supplementary Fig. 21d), whereasknockout of OsEIL1 ,OsEIL2 orOsERF82 incrw1 suppressed the upre- gulation of these genes (Supplementary Fig. 21d). Taken together, ampli ﬁed OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 causes ROS accumulation in crw1 root tips likely by promoting the transcription of OsRBOHH and Class III OsPRX genes.Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Nature Communications |         (2025) 16:3712 7 Mechanical resistance on the root tip rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 After identifying ampli ﬁed ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/2- OsERF82 leading to ROS overproduction as the cause of impairedgravitropism in crw1, we explored the mechanism underlying the res- cue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 when plants were grown inwater-saturated paddy soil and other solid media (Supplementary Fig. 3).

These results suggestthat a gentle mechanical resistance of ≥34 Pa is suf ﬁcient to rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1. To further examine the effect of mechanical resistance, we attached a polystyrene foam pellet (1-mm diameter) to the root tip ofcrw1 grown in water, which applied a mechanical stimulus to the root tip through the buoyance of water against the foam pellet (Fig. 6d). The pellet was open at the top to allow normal gas diffusion. Theresistance of the foam pellet to the root tip was estimated to beapproximately 104 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 23). The attachment offoam pellet did not affect the root cap size and symmetric auxin dis-tribution in WT, but largely rescued the root cap size, auxin distribu-tion and the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 24 and Fig. 6e, f), indicating that the root tip is the site for sensing mechanical stimulus which rescues the loss of gravitropism in crw1. Soil compaction may restrict ethylene diffusion away from plant roots, thus amplifying ethylene signaling and inhibiting root growth 30. We compared root growth of WT and crw1 in a paddy soil packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3)a n dah i g h( 1 . 6gc m−3) bulk density. Both levels of bulk density restored the coiling root phenotype of crw1 to straight roots. At 1.0 bulk density, WT, crw1 and two oscrw1KOmutants showed similar root length (Supplementary Fig. 25). Increasing bulk density to1.6 decreased the root length of WT by 36% and of crw1 and two oscrw1 KOmutants by 47-51% (Supplementary Fig. 25). The larger inhi- bition in crw1 is consistent with the heightened ethylene signaling. Mechanosensing rescuing crw1 phenotype requires calcium signaling in the root cap Calcium (Ca2+) is a critical signal in plant responses to mechanical stimuli48,49.T oi n v e s t i g a t ew h e t h e rC a2+signaling is involved in the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1,w ee x p r e s s e d NES- YC3.650, a cytosolic Ca2+([Ca2+]cyt) reporter gene, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter in WT and then introduced the gene into crw1 through crossing. The root caps of both WT and crw1 growing in four different solid media showed a signi ﬁcantly higher [Ca2+]cytsignal than those growing in water, and there were no signi ﬁcant differences between WT and crw1 (Fig. 7a, b). Similarly, the [Ca2+]cytsignal remained low in the root caps of both WT and crw1 when grown in 0.3% and 0.4% agar, and increased signi ﬁcantly when both were grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Supplementary Fig. 26). These results suggest that agentle mechanical resistance of approximately ≥34 Pa enhances [Ca 2+]cytin the root cap and beyond this threshold there is no further increase in [Ca2+]cyt. Moreover, loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 does not affect [Ca2+]cytin the root cap or its response to mechanical resistance. To investigate whether the enhanced Ca2+signal in the root cap is involved in the recovery of crw1 ’s phenotypes, we applied 100 μM LaCl 3,aC a2+channel blocker, to 0.8% agar. We found that LaCl 3sup- pressed [Ca2+]cytin the root caps (Fig. 7c, d) and largely abolished the rescue effect of mechanical resistance on the root cap size and auxindistribution (Fig. 7e, f). Importantly, the addition of LaCl 3abolished the recovery of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Fig. 7g and Supplementary Fig. 27), indicating the root cap calcium signal triggered by mechanosensing is required for the rescue ofgravitropism in crw1. The observation that growing in soil prevented overaccumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in crw1 roots (Fig. 4a, b) suggests that mechanosensing-Ca 2+signaling may rescue the root coiling phenotype ofcrw1 by limiting the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 when grown in 0.4% agar, and accumulation of the two proteins was sup-pressed to the WT levels when grown in 0.8% agar (Fig. 7h, i). Addition of 100 μML a C l 3to 0.8% agar suppressed [Ca2+]cytin the root caps, r e s u l t i n gi na no v e r - a c c u m u l a t i o no fO s E I L 1a n dO s E I L 2i nt h e crw1roots (Fig. 7h, i). There were no signi ﬁcant differences in the transcript levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 between WT and crw1 in different agar concentrations or between 0.8% agar with and without addition ofLaCl 3(Supplementary Fig. 28), su ggesting that the effect of mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling on the protein levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 is not related to transcriptional regulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 . Furthermore, upregulation of OsERF82 and excess ROS pro- duction in crw1 roots were observed when grown in 0.4% agar but not in 0.8% agar, whereas the addition of LaCl 3to 0.8% agar medium sig- niﬁcantly increased OsERF82 transcription and ROS accumulation in crw1 roots (Fig. 7j and Supplementary Fig. 29). In WT roots, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins were kept at low levels because of the presence ofOsCRW1, which likely explains the lack of response of OsERF82 tran- scription and ROS level to mechano-sensing induced Ca 2+signaling in WT. These results suggest that mechano-sensing induced Ca2+signal- ing inhibits the ampli ﬁed module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS in crw1, and rescues the root cap structure, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and consequently gravitropism. The root coiling phenotype in hydroponics occurs in natural rice accessions Rice roots show considerable natural variation in the growth pheno- type when grown in hydroponics. During the screen of a panel of 230rice accessions consisting mainly of landraces in the lower YangtzeRiver delta in China, we found that 53, 46 and 131 accessions exhibitedthe root coiling, straight root, and intermediate phenotypes, respec- tively, when grown in water (Supplementary Fig. 30a). We randomly selected 8 accessions each with coiling or straight roots (Supplemen-tary Fig. 30b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the group of rootcoiling accessions had a signi ﬁcantly lower level of OsCRW1 transcript than the group with straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30d). Additionof 1-MCP to water straightened the coiling roots (SupplementaryFig. 30e), suggesting the phenotype in these rice accessions is likelycaused by enhanced ethylene signaling. When grown in water-saturated paddy soil, the root coiling phenotype was completely res-cued (Supplementary Fig. 30f), which is consistent with the phenotyperecovery of crw1. In highly compacted soil, coiling-root accessions showed shorter root elongation than straight-root accessions, which is consistent with the phenotypes of crw1 and WT, respectively (Sup- plementary Fig. 30g). Discussion Ethylene plays a critical role in plant growth, development and resis-tance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Because ethylene bio-synthesis ﬂuctuates widely under the in ﬂuence of changing environments 18,51, its effect on gravitropic growth of roots must be tightly regulated. In this study, by dissecting the genetic basis for theroot coiling phenotype in the rice mutant crw1, we uncovered the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1)-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots (Fig. 8). Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescuedroot coiling phenotype of crw1, we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling,thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig. 8). The gravitropic growth of roots depends on the perception of gravity by the root cap and the symmetric distribution of auxin in theroot tip. The former requires amyloplast as the gravity responder totransmit the gravity signal via LAZY proteins 6,7, and the latter is tightly controlled by polar-localized auxin transporters such as PIN212.M u t a - tions of critical genes in auxin transport (e.g. pin212,aux113,eir136), amyloplast synthesis52,53and gravity signaling6,7cause plant roots to display defective gravitropic behaviors during vertical growth. Theimpact of ethylene signaling on root gravitropism appears to varyamong plant species. In Arabidopsis , loss-of-function mutations of the key genes that control ethylene biosynthesis or signal transduction,Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Nature Communications |         (2025) 16:3712 10 including ETO1 ,CTR1, EIN2, andEIN3, did not affect gravitropic growth of roots35. In contrast, disruption of EIL1andEIN2 homologous genes in rice or maize resulted in enlarged angle of adventitious roots when grown in hydroponic, indicating a weakened gravitropism35.I nt h e present study, we found that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led tocoiling of both seminal and adventitious roots of rice in hydroponicculture, indicative of a severe disruption of gravitropism. The F-boxproteins EBFs bind to EIN3 and EIL proteins, thus promoting theirdegradation via a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway 27,28. The loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to overaccumulation of OsEIL1/2proteins in rice roots and consequently ampli ﬁed ethylene signaling. We identi ﬁed OsERF82, a hitherto unreported ethylene response fac- tor, as the downstream target of OsEIL1/2. OsERF82 transcriptionallyregulates the expression of several genes involved in ROS production,including OsRBOHH and several Class III peroxidase genes.

Apart from OsERF82, it is possible that other target genesregulated by OsEIL1 may also play a small role in the coiling root phenotype of crw1. We found that excessive ROS accumulation in the root tip of crw1 accelerates root cap sloughing through programed cell death, therebyreducing the number of amyloplast and weakening gravity perception.Furthermore, excessive accumulation of ROS disrupted the symme-trical auxin distribution in the root tip by impairing the polar locali-zation of OsPIN2. This is consistent with an earlier ﬁnding that application of exogenous H 2O2inhibits vesicle-mediated traf ﬁcking and polar localization of AtPIN2 in Arabidopsis54. Disrupted polar localization of OsPIN2 and reduced root cap stability together explainthe severe loss of gravitropism in crw1 roots. Thus, limiting ethylene signaling in the nucleus is critical for the normal gravitropic growth of rice roots. Although growing in compacted soil may increase the ethylene level in roots due to restricted gas diffusion 30, we found that gentle mechanical resistance that rice roots typically encounter in water-saturated paddy soil or other soft solid media enhances the degra-dation of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 and thus dampens the excessive ethylenesignaling in crw1 , leading to rescue of the root coiling phenotype. The mechanical resistance required to antagonize ethylene signal-ing ampli ﬁcation is mild (penetration resistance ≥34 Pa), consistent with the soft nature of submerged paddy soil that rice plants areadapted to. This level of mechanical resistance is more than an order of magnitude lower than in water unsaturated and compacted soil used in the study of Pandey et al. 30. Strong mechanical resistance can inhibit root elongation or change the direction of root growth. Forexample, root tips stop growing when encountering three-dimensional impenetrable compactness 30, change direction toavoid a ﬂat obstacle55, or grow in a wavy or circular manner on an impenetrable agar slope56–58. A recent study showed that Arabidopsis roots growing on the agar surface can produce different growth paths in response to subtle changes of mechanical forces59. In the present study, mild mechanical resistance did not affect the normalroot growth of WT but was suf ﬁcient to ensure gravitropic root growth of crw1 and coiling-root accessions, suggesting that mechanical resistance below the level that inhibits root growth canbe sensed by rice roots to help safeguard gravitropism. Such aneffect has not been reported before but is consistent with previousﬁndings that plants can sensitively perceive different strengths of mechanical stimuli from nature and produce rapid thigmonasticresponses or gradual morphogenetic alterations 60,61. We found that the rescue of root gravitropism in crw1 by gentle mechanical resistance requires Ca2+signaling in the root cap. In the absence of OsCRW1/OsEBF1, mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling safeguards the gravitropic growth of crw1 roots by suppressing the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. How enhanced Ca2+signaling in the root cap prevents over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2remains unclear and warrants further investigation. The observationthat knockout of OsEBF2 incrw1 d i dn o ta f f e c tt h er e s c u eo ft h er o o t coiling phenotype by gentle mechanical resistance suggests thatenhanced Ca 2+signaling promotes the degradation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in an OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and OsEBF2-independentmechanism. Mechanosensing-induced Ca 2+signaling may play a parti- cularly important role in keeping ethylene signaling in check under stress conditions, which suppress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF143, or in natural rice accessions with a weak or loss-of-function OsCRW1.On the other hand, although OsCRW1 may be dispensable in uncom-pacted soil, it is needed to restrict excessive ethylene signaling incompacted soil to reduce the inhibition on root growth.Fig. 7 | Mechanosensing induced Ca2+signaling antagonizes ethylene signaling to maintain root gravitropism in crw1. a,bWT and crw1 (both expressing NES- YC3.6 ) were grown in water or different soil for 2 days. aThe NES-YC3.6 ﬂuores- cence in the root caps. bQuanti ﬁcation of NES-YC3.6 ﬂuorescence in the root caps. c–jWT and crw1 expressing various reporters were grown in 0.4% and 0.8% agar with or without 100 μML a C l 3for 2−3d a y s .( c) Cytosolic Ca2+in the root caps detected by NES-YC3.6. dQuanti ﬁcation of NES-YC3.6 intensity. eLugol ’ss t a i n i n g of root caps. fDR5rev::VENUS ﬂuorescence of root tips. gRoot phenotypes. h,iLevel of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in WT and crw1 roots by immunoblot.OsEIL1-Flag and OsEIL2-Flag proteins were detected by Flag antibody (anti-Flag) and the Actin (anti-Actin) was used as a loading control. jTranscriptional level of OsERF82 in roots by Q-PCR.

Fig. 8 | A model of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing inhibiting ethylene signaling to maintain root gravitropism. The presence of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing of root tips maintains root gravitropism in soil. OsCRW1 and the mechanosensing induced Ca2+signaling inhibit the ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82 to control ROS homeostasis in root tips, consequently maintaining the structural stability of root cap and polar localization of OsPIN2, ultimately ensuringgravitropism in rice roots. Some components of this Figure were creased with Adobe Illustrator ( https://helpx.adobe.com/cn/support/illustrator.html ).Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Nature Communications |         (2025) 16:3712 12 Interestingly, we observed that the root coiling phenotype was present in some natural rice accessions when grown in hydroponics,and the phenotype was apparently related to the transcription level ofOsCRW1/OsEBF1 . Some of the coiling-root accessions had a OsCRW1/ OsEBF1 transcript level similar to those in the straight-root accessions, s u g g e s t i n gt h a tv a r i a t i o ni nt h ep r o t e i nl e v e lo ri nt h ec o d i n gs e q u e n c emay also be involved. Growing these rice accessions in soft paddy soilalso restored their gravitropic growth. A lower level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may be advantageous for stress resistance because ofenhanced ethylene signaling, especially when root gravitropic growthcan be safeguarded by mechanosensing. Several stress responsepathways were enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs)between crw1 and WT (Fig. 3b). Among these DEGs, at least 24 genes that were upregulated in crw1 have been previously reported to be involved in the resistance to drought, salinity, cold, or diseases (Sup- plemental Fig. 31). Evolution of land plants is accompanied with expansion of genes involved in hormone signaling and transcriptionfactors 62. Our study shows that mechanosensing induced Ca2+signal- ing plays an unexpected role in balancing the ethylene-auxin signalingpathways for gravitropic growth of plants in soil. Methods Plant materials and growth conditions The japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua11 was used as the wild type (WT)for all experiments. An ethyl methylsulfonate (EMS)-mutagenizedpopulation (M3 generation) was used for root phenotype screening. Transgenic plant materials were generated as described below. Seeds were surface sterilized with 15% NaClO for 30 min, washed withsterilized water, and placed in a 37 °C incubator for 2 days to pro-mote germination. Germinated seeds were transferred to hydro-ponic boxes, soil culture boxes or agar plates to grow depending onthe requirements of different experiments. Experiments were carriedout in a growth room with the following conditions: temperature 28°C ± 0.5 °C, humidity 50% –60%, 12-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 100 mmol of photons m −2s−1. WT and mutant were also grown in two paddy ﬁelds (Nanjing and Sanya) to maturity. Agro- nomic traits, including plant height, tiller number, percentage of ﬁlled grains, 1000-grain weight and grain biomass per plant, were determined at plant maturity. Plasmid construction and plant transformation The CRISPR/Cas9 system63was used to knock out OsCRW1 (Os06g0605900 )a n d OsEBF2 (Os02g0200900 )i nt h eZ h o n g h u a 1 1 background and OsEBF2 ,OsEIL1 (Os03g0324200 ), OsEIL2 (Os07g0685700 ),OsERF2 (Os06g0181700 ),OsERF81 (Os02g0520000 ), and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800 )i nt h e crw1 background. Two 20-bp target sequences were selected from the coding sequence (CDS) ofeach gene and cloned into two single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes of pYLgRNA-OsU6a and pYLgRNA-OsU6b by overlapping PCR, producing proU6a-T1-sgRNA and proU6b-T2-sgRNA fragments, respectively. The two fragments were sequentially cloned into theBsaI site of the pYLCRISPR-Cas9Pubi-H vector to generate the ultimate plasmids. To generate the complementation constructs of proOsCR- W1::OsCRW1 ,proOs06g0604400:: Os06g0604400 and proOs06- g0619600::Os06g0619600 ,w ea m p l i ﬁed the promoter (1739 bp of proOsCRW1 ,3K bo f proOs06g0604400 and 3 Kb of proOs06g0619600 ) and the open reading frame (ORF) of OsCRW1 ,Os06g0604400 and Os06g0619600 from the DNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and ORF were cloned together by overla p p i n gP C Ra n di n t r o d u c e di n t o t h eE c o R I / X b a Is i t eo ft h e pCAMBIAL1301 vector. To generate proOsCRW1::GFP constructs, we ampli ﬁed the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11and the GFP sequence from thepUN1301 vector with addition of the initiation codon. The promoter and GFP sequence were cloned together by overlapping PCR and intro-duced into the HindIII/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. To generatepOsCRW1::GUS constructs, we ampli ﬁed the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced OsCRW1 pro- moter into the HindIII/BamHI site of the p1300 vector. To generate proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag and proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag constructs, we ampli ﬁed the promoter (2588 bp of proOsEIL1 ,2 5 0 0 b po f proOsEIL2 ) and the full-length CDS (without the stop codon) of OsEIL1 andOsEIL2 from the DNA and cDNA of Zhonghua 11. The promoter and CDS were cloned together by overlapping P CR and introduced into the BamHI/ SpeI site of the pTCK303 vector. To generate proUbi::OsEIL1 (OsEIL1-OX) andproUbi::OsEIL2 (OsEIL2-OX) constructs, we ampli ﬁed the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 andOsEIL2 from the cDNA of cv. ZH11 and introduced the CDS segments into the BamHI/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. The plasmids were transformed into the callus of Zhonghua11 or crw1 using Agrobacterium -mediated transformation64. Transformants were veri ﬁed by PCR. All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Zhonghua11 expressing DR5rev::VENUS65,proOsPIN2::OsPIN2- GFP14,o r NES-YC3.665were obtained from previous studies. These genotypes and Zhonghua11 expressing proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag were crossed with crw1 oroscrw1KOlines (maternal) to obtain the reporter or tag lines in the mutant backgroundby PCR. The F3 seeds were used for experiments. Root growth experiments Germinated seeds were placed on a net ﬂoating on deionized water for ten days and then transferred to ½ strength Kimura B nutrient solution66for different durations according to the requirements of experiments. The nutrient solution was changed every three days, andthe pH was maintained at 5.6-5.8. To investigate the effects of nutri-ents, pH, light and dissolved oxygen level on root phenotypes, we grewseedlings of crw1 and WT in hydroponic boxes ﬁlled with deionized water or nutrient solution at the ¼ and ½ strength, different solutionpH (from 4 to 8), light condition (12 h/12 h light/dark or 24 h dark), withor without aeration treatment (dissolved oxygen level 12.45 and5.36 mg/L, respectively). To compare the root phenotypes grown inwater and solid media, we grew germinated seedlings in water (pH =5.6-5.8), water-saturated paddy soil, water-saturated vermiculite or water-saturated peat pellet for 2-10 days. Dissolved oxygen con- centrations in hydroponic solution and soil were measured using adissolved oxygen probe. In some experiments, paddy soil was packedat a normal (1.0 g cm −3)a n dah i g h( 1 . 6 g c m−3) bulk density. The penetration resistance of soil and other solid growth media was mea-sured by using a soil compactness tester. To investigate the effect of mechanical resistance on root pheno- types, we grew seedlings of WT and crw1 in agar-solidi ﬁed medium with 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 or 1.2% (w/ v) agar in square Petri dishes. The top 2-cm agar was removed and the emerged seminal roots (1-2 mm)of WT and crw1 were embedded in the agar and allowed to grow verti- cally for 2 to 3 days. To apply resistance on root tips, we made polystyrene foam spherical pellets (1 mm diameter) with a slit in themiddle, placed root tip into the slit and grew seedlings in deionizedwater for 2-3 days. For chemical treatment, L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn, 10 μM), 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP, 10 μM), 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic Acid (ACC, 1 μM), N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), diphenyleneiodo- nium (DPI, 50 nM), salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) or LaCl 3 (100μM )w e r ea d d e dt od e i o n i z e dw a t e ro ra g a rm e d i u ma c c o r d i n gt o different experiments. Each genotype and treatment had at least 3 bio-logical replicates, 7-12 plants per replicate in short-term hydroponicexperiments, 3-6 plants per replicate in long-term hydroponic experi-ments, 3-4 plants per replicate in petri dish experiments, and 7-12 plants per replicate in soil-vermiculite experiments. MutMap-based gene cloning To clone the causal gene responsible for the coiling-root phenotype of crw1, we backcrossed crw1 to WT (Zhonghua11) to generate F 1Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Nature Communications |         (2025) 16:3712 13 progenies. F 1progenies were selfed to generate F 2progenies. DNA was extracted from 50 F 2plants showing the coiling-root phenotype in water and mixed in equal proportions to generate a pooled genomicDNA of crw1. A pooled genomic DNA of WT was prepared in the same way. Genome sequencing was performed using Illumina Hiseq4000 at 5 0 ×a n d3 0 ×c o v e r a g ef o r crw1 and WT, respectively), generating 150- bp paired-end reads. After removing the adapter sequences and low-quality reads, clean reads were mapped to the reference genomesequence (OsNipponbare-Reference-RGAP7, MSU) using BWAsoftware 67, followed by SNP-calling using GATK software68.

Tissue expression pattern analysis of OsCRW1 Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GUS were grown in water for 3 days before being used for histochemical staining for the GUS activity in roots, and in nutrient solution for different durationsfor GUS staining of leaves and reproductive organs. Roots and othertissues were incubated with a GUS staining solution for 2 h at 37 °C,transferred to 70% ethanol overnight, and then photographed underan ultra-depth stereoscopic microscope (Leica, DVM6a). Transgenicrice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GFP were grown in water for 3 days and roots were cut and were placed on a slide for ﬂuorescence imaging under a macro zoom microscope (Carl Zeiss, MVX10). The GFP ﬂuor- escence was observed at 505-560 nm for emission and 488 nm forexcitation. Subcellular localization of OsCRW1 and OsERF82 To generate constructs of GFP-OsCRW1 orGFP-OsERF82 driven by the CaMV35S promoter ( pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 orpro35S::GFP-OsERF82 ), we ampli ﬁed the full-length CDS of OsCRW1 orOsERF82 from the cDNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced the CDS into the HindIII/EcoRI site of thepSAT6-GFP-C vector. The fragments of pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82 were isolated from the pSAT6-GFP-C vector by PI- PspI endonuclease and introduced into the PI-PspI site of the pRCS2 vector. The plasmids were transformed into rice protoplasts for tran-sient expression 70. Protoplasts were isolated from rice stems and labeled with the nucleus marker 4 ’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for co-localization. The GFP and DAPI ﬂuorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, LSM780) at505-560 nm and 400-470 nm for emission, respectively, and at 488 nmand 360 nm for excitation, respectively. Root cap size observation and amyloplast staining Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut and stained with 0.1%(w/v) basic fuchsin solution for 6 h. Root tips were resin-embedded,sectioned according to a previous method 71, and photographed under a microscope to reveal the root cap size. Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut, stained with 5% (v/v) Lugol ’ss o l u t i o nf o r1m i n u t e , washed with distilled water, and photographed under a microscope forthe observation of the amyloplasts in the root caps. Lugol ’ss t o c k solution was prepared by dissolving 5% (m/v) iodine in 10% (m/v) KIsolution. Fluorescence imaging of OsPIN2 localization, auxin response, cytosolic Ca2+and ROS Plants expressing proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP or the reporter gene for auxin response ( DR5rev::VENUS ) or for cytosolic Ca2+(NES-YC3.6 , dri- ven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter) were grown under different growth conditions or treatments for two to three days. Root tips were cut and immediately observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope. The GFP ﬂuorescence was observed as described above. The VENUS ﬂuorescence was observed at 520-550 nm for emission and 515 nm for excitation. For NES-YC3.6 detection, the measurement ofcpVENUS/ECFP ratio shifts was based on ﬂuorescence resonanceenergy transfer according to a previous method 50. The ECFP ﬂuores- cence was observed at 460-490 nm for emission and 415 nm for exci-tation. For detection of ROS, roots were incubated with 10 μM H 2DCFDA for 10 mins, washed with deionized water, and the ROS ﬂuorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning micro- scope at 505-560 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation,respectively 65. TUNEL assay The TUNEL assay was used to detect the programed cell death of rootcaps. Root tips were sampled and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 mins, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).Root tips were immersed in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for5 mins, washed with PBS, and incubated in the TUNEL detection solu-tion (Beyotime, China) at 37 °C for 1 h. The TUNEL ﬂuorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 515-565 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) The Y2H assay was used to detect the interaction between OsCRW1and OsEIL1 or OsEIL2.The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The full-length CDSofOsEIL1 orOsEIL2 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pGADT7 to generate the pGADT7-OsEIL1 and pGADT7-EIL2 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain (AD). The pGBKT7-OsCRW1 plasmid and pGADT7- OsEIL1 orpGADT7-OsEIL2 plasmid were transformed into the Y2H Gold yeast strain alone or in pairs. pGBKT7-53 together with pGADT7- Twere transformed as a positive control, and pGBKT7-lam together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium(-Trp, -Leu) to an optical density (OD) of 0.8. The serially dilutedyeast solution was inoculated on a double-de ﬁcient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu) and a quadruple-de ﬁcient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu, -His, -Ade, +X- α-gal) for growth. Bimolecular ﬂuorescence complementation The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was fused to the vector of pDONR221- P3P2 , and the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 andOsEIL2 were fused to the vector of pDONR221-P1P4 by gateway cloning, and then were trans- ferred into pBiFCt-2in1-NN vector alone or in pairs by LR clonase to fuse with the N- and C-terminal fragments of yellow ﬂuorescent protein (YFP). The ﬁnal plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tume- faciens strain GV3101. Bacterial cultures of the test combinations and controls were in ﬁltrated into tobacco (Latin name) leaves. Two days after in ﬁltration, the YFP signal was detected under confocal laser microscopy at 520-550 nm and 515 nm for emission and excitation, respectively. Western blot For immunological detection of OsEIL1-Flag, OsEIL2-Flag and OsActinin the roots of WT and crw1, total soluble proteins were extracted from 15-20 seminal roots with 1 ml plant protein extraction buffer. Proteinswere denatured by heating at 95 oC for 10 min in a metal-bath and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, proteins were transferredonto a polyvinylidene di ﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane and immunoblots were probed with the following antibodies in the TBST solution(100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%(v/v) Tween 20, pH=7.4) with 5% non-fat dry milk. A mouse anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and a mouse anti-Actin antibody (Beyotime, AA128,1:5000 dilution) were used as the primary antibodies and HPR-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Beyotime, A0216, 1:5000 dilution)was used as the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence wasArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Nature Communications |         (2025) 16:3712 14 performed using ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturer ’si n s t r u c t i o n s . Yeast one-hybrid The full-length CDS of OsEIL1 ,OsEIL2 orOsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGADT7 vector to express fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain. To detectthe binding of OsEIL1/2 with the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on thepromoter of OsERF82 , we introduced three copies of EBS into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in EBS was designed (EBS mut, CGAGA) and used as a negative control. To detect the binding of OsERF82 with the GCC-box (GCCGCC), G-box(CACGTG) and DRE/CRT (GCCGAC) on the promoter sequence ofOsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes, we introduced three copies of DRE/CRT, GCC box and G box sequence into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in each potential binding site was designed (GCC-box mut, ACCACC; G-box mut, AACTTG; DRE/ CRT mut, GTCGAA) and used as a negative control. pAbAi carrying dif- ferent binding sites were transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain toscreen the proper concentration of aureobasidin A (AbA) for inhibitingtranscriptional self-activation. pGADT7 carrying OsEIL1 orOsEIL2 or OsERF82 ,a n d pAbAi carrying different sequences were co-transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain. The yeast colonies were cultured in Leu-deﬁcient SD liquid medium to OD of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Leu-de ﬁcient SD medium (with or without AbA) for growth. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) The full-length CDS of OsEIL1 ,OsEIL2 orOsERF82 were introduced into the NdeI/XhoI site of the pET29a vector and transformed into Escher- ichia coli BL21 to express OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His or OsERF82-His fusion protein. OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His and OsERF82-His fusion proteins werepuriﬁed from E. coli by nickel af ﬁnity columns. Primers were designed for the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter sequence ofOsERF82 or designed for the ERF-binding sites including the GCC box, the G box and the DRE/CRT sequence on the promoter sequence ofOsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes to synthesize biotin-labeled probes, unlabeled probes, and unlabeled mutation probes. The pro- tein and probe were incubated with EMSA reaction solution (preparedaccording to the manufacturer ’s protocol, Beyotime, China) for 20 min at room temperature, separated on a 5% polyacrylamide native gel at4 °C, and transferred to a nylon membrane. After UV light cross-link-ing, the DNA on the membrane was detected using the Chemilumi-nescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module. Primers used are listed inSupplementary Table 2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)- qPCR assay The ChIP assay was performed using the BeyoChIP ™ChIP Assay Kit (Beyotime, P2080S, China) according to the manufacturer ’si n s t r u c - tions. Plants of pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/ crw1 were grown in water for two day, and 15-20 roots were collected as one biological replicate, with three biological replicates for eachexperiment. Root tissue was cross-linked in 1% (v/v) formaldehydeunder vacuum. Chromatin was extracted from the samples and frag-mented via ultrasound treatment to a size of 200-500 bp, and 2% of theyield was set aside as input template. The OsEIL1-DNA and OsEIL2-DNAcomplex were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (Invi-trogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and protein A/G beads (Beyotime,P2080S, China), or coimmunoprecipitated with IgG (Beyotime, A7028,China) with protein A/G beads. NaCl (0.2 M) was added to the solution of protein-DNA complex and heated at 65 °C for 4 hours to remove the cross-linking between protein and genomic DNA. According to themanufacturer ’s instructions, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloro- form agent for DNA puri ﬁcation (Solarbio, T0250, China). Primers (Supplementary Table 3) were designed near the three EBS sequenceson the OsERF82 promoter. Primers and puri ﬁed DNA were used for ChIP-qPCR. Transactivation activity of OsERF82 The full-length CDS of OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion protein containing the yeast GAL4 transcriptionbinding domain (BD). The pGBKT7-OsERF82 plasmid was transformed into the AH109 yeast strain. pGBKT7 plasmid was transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Drop-out (SD) liquid medium (-Trp) to OD = 0.8. The serially diluted yeastsolution was inoculated on Trp-de ﬁcient SD medium and double- deﬁcient SD medium (-Trp, -His, +X- α-gal) for growth. RNA sequencing RNA sequencing was performed on roots of crw1 and WT grown in water or in a soil-vermiculite mixture for two days. Each group con-tained three replicates with 15-20 plants per replicate. Total RNA wasextracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke). The cDNAlibraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencingplatform at Benagen Technology (Wuhan, China), and 150-bp paired-end reads were generated. For the analysis of gene expression, frag-ments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads and readcounts of each unigene were calculated and normalized based on thenumber of uniquely positioned reads overlapping the exon regions.Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identi ﬁed using R software (v.3.5.1) with the DESeq2 package ( http://bioconductor.org/packages/ release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html ). RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (Bio- Teke, Beijing, China). A HiScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit(Vazyme, Nanjing, China) was used to convert 1 μgo ft o t a lR N At o 20μL cDNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on an RT-PCR detection system (CFX96, Bio-Rad) by using SYBR Green Master Mix(Vazyme, Nanjing, China). OsActin and OsHistone were used as the internal reference genes. The expression levels were calculated using the equation 2 –Δ(ΔCt). Primers are shown in Supplementary Table 3.

Clinical data on the appropriate use of liposomal-amphotericin B (liposomal-AmB) with cryptococcal  meningitis are limited. Here, we report for the first time the efficacious and safe use of the ideal bodyweight to calculate the dose  of liposomal-AmB for a severely obese patient with C albidus meningitis. We also review the cases of CNS infection caused by C  albidus and its related species. Patient concerns: A severely obese female patient was admitted to neurosurgical ward with lesions in the intracranial space  and accompanying headache. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed prominent lesions in the right parietal and left frontal  insular region. After glioma resection, C albidus was isolated from her cerebrospinal fluid samples. Diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes: She diagnosed histopathologically with a Cryptococcus species infection.  The culture from her cerebrospinal fluid sample showed the growth of yeast-like colonies, which were identified as C albidus with  mass spectrometry. She was treated with liposomal-AmB (50 mg day-1 intravenously) plus 5-fluorocytosine (10 g day-1 orally in 4  divided doses) for 6 weeks. The patient was asymptomatic at the time of discharge. Lessons: CNS infections of C albidus were uncommon. Using ideal bodyweight to calculate the dose of liposomal-AmB should  be considered for severely obese patients with C albidus meningitis.

Introduction Central nervous system (CNS) infections of Cryptococcus species  are life-threatening diseases. C albidus, also called Naganishia  albida, was first reported to infect humans in 1965,[1] and sev- eral opportunistic infections associated with C albidus have  since been reported.[2–4] To date, the yeast has been isolated from  the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), lung abscesses, pleural fluids, and  blood specimens of patients.[5] Of those invasive infections, 30%  of the patients had a CNS infections.[6] Most notably, the mor - tality rate was 67% in patients with CNS infections caused by  C albidus, which is more than double that of patients infected with other Cryptococcus species.[6] Although fewer than 10  cases of C albidus infection have been reported,[1,7] the fungus  has received attention because its mortality rate is high. Here,  we report a clinical case of cryptococcal meningitis caused by  C albidus. Clinically isolated C albidus may include many other  related species, for example, C adeliensis and C diffluent.[8] No  clear-cut epidemiological markers have been described to deter - mine the likelihood of C albidus. Recommended guidelines for  its treatment are also lacking. Therefore, it is extremely import- ant to identify the risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis,  and treatment for CNS infection due to C albidus and its related  species.

Case presentation A 25-year-old female patient (height was 158 cm, bodyweight  was 100 kg) was admitted to Beijing Electric Power Hospital  (Beijing, China) in March, 2022 with lesions in the intracra- nial space and accompanying headache. Six months before  admission to the hospital, she had undergone successful left  temporoparietal occipital craniotomy and decompressive  craniectomy. Afterwards, she subsequently suffered inter - mittent headache, concurrently with nausea and disordered  consciousness, and was treated with mannitol and levetirac- etam before her admission. The patient denied any family  or medical history, except invasive procedures of her CNS 6  months previously. She was a farmer, in frequent contact with  cats and dogs. A physical examination revealed no unusual  findings. Specifically, her body temperature was 36 °C, blood  pressure 130/70 mm Hg, pulse rate 68 beats/min, and respira- tory rate 17 breaths/min. Brain magnetic resonance imaging  revealed prominent lesions in the right parietal accompanied  by moderate edema and left frontal insular region with mild  edema. The lesion volume in the right parietal region and the  left frontal insular was about 4 × 4 × 3 cm3 and 3 × 3 × 3 cm3,  respectively (Fig.  1). On day 0 (admission), the patient’s associated laboratory  data were normal. Specifically, her white blood cell count  was 9.5 × 109 L-1; neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes  accounted for 73.8%, 21.1%, and 4.9%, respectively. Her red  blood cell count was 4.4 × 1012 L-1, hemoglobin level was 133.0 g  L-1, and platelet count was 213.0 × 109 L-1. Urinalysis, hepatic  and renal function tests were normal. During hospitalization,  no chemotherapy and/or other immunosuppressive drug was administered. On day 5 after admission, the patient underwent  right parieto-occipital for glioma resection. However, her head- ache persisted. In the postoperative period, the patient experienced seizures,  treated with mannitol and valproic acid. On day 14, she was  diagnosed histopathologically with a Cryptococcus species  infection. On day 16, the culture from her CSF sample showed  the growth of yeast-like colonies, which were identified as C  albidus with VITEK mass spectrometry (BioMerieux, France).  To date, no Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute clinical  breakpoints or epidemiological cutoff values have been estab- lished for C albidus. The susceptibility of the pathogen to 5  antifungal compounds was tested in accordance with the guide- lines of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute document  M27-A3.[9] The minimal inhibitory concentrations of ampho- tericin B (AmB), fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, and 5-  fluorocytosine for C albidus were determined to be 0.5, 4, 1,  0.125, and 4 mg L-1, respectively. After the patient was diagnosed with a Cryptococcus species  infection, she was administered with of liposomal-AmB (50 mg  day-1 intravenously) qd plus 5-fluorocytosine (10 g day-1 orally  in 4 divided doses) for 6 weeks. Her magnetic resonance imag- ing results showed that only the left frontal insular region still  had a lesion, with otherwise normal parenchyma, after 3 weeks  of treatment (Fig.  2). In addition, no yeast was isolated from  3 different CSF samples after 4 weeks of treatment (Table 1).  The patient maintained normal renal function during the entire  treatment period (Fig.  3). On day 48 after admission, the patient  stopped complaining of headache, and suffered no further nau- sea or consciousness disorder. The patient was asymptomatic at  Figure 1.

The lesion was about 4 × 4 × 3 cm3 in size (red arrow) and accompanied by moderate edema of  surrounding brain tissue (yellow arrow). Another type of circular lesion was deep in the left frontal lobe, with long signals on T1-weighted (A) and T2-weighted  (B) images. The lesion was about 3 × 3 × 3 cm3 in size (red arrow) and accompanied by mild edema (yellow arrow). Enhanced MRI scanning showed that the  lesions were unevenly and significantly enhanced (C). 3Wang et al. • Medicine (2025) 104:17 www.md-journal.com the time of discharge, with normal glucose, protein, and lactate  levels in the CSF. 3. Discussion C albidus in the genus Cryptococcus, is a rare species that causes  cryptococcal infections, especially in the CNS infections. The  antifungal treatment recommended for cryptococcal meningo- encephalitis is liposomal-AmB plus flucytosine.[10,11] Although  liposomal-AmB has been used for several decades, little is  known about its pharmacokinetics in obese patients.[12,13] The  prescribing information for cryptococcal disease recommends  weight-based doses of 0.7 to 6 mg/kg/day AmB, depending upon  the AmB product used. To date, the calculation of the appro- priate dose for severely obese patients is controversial.[13,14] Animal studies have demonstrated significantly increased AmB  serum concentrations and increased rates of nephrotoxicity in  obese rats and rabbits, with poor distribution of adipose tis- sue.[15] Furthermore, women have a higher body fat rate than  men, which is a risk factor for acute kidney injury caused by  liposomal-AmB.[16] Therefore, it may be reasonable to consider  the ideal bodyweight rather than the actual bodyweight when  calculating the dose of liposomal-AmB for severely obese female  patients. In this case, we have demonstrated the efficacy and  safety of using the ideal bodyweight, rather than the actual  bodyweight, to calculate the dose of liposomal-AmB for a  severely obese patient with C albidus meningitis. A comprehensive review of the literature was performed  in accordance with the “Preferred Reporting Items for  Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis.”[17–19] Studies of case  Figure 2.

The lesion in the right parietal lobe was resected, whereas the lesion in the left frontal lobe (red arrow) was still  observed with long signals on T1-weighted (A) and T2-weighted (B) images. Enhanced MRI scanning showed that the lesion was only mildly enhanced after  treatment (C). Table 1 Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid.

The references in  each manuscript were also reviewed to identify additional  cases. Our searches yielded 104 potentially relevant records. After  nonhuman species (e.g., dog, cat, pigeon) were excluded,[20,21]  86 studies were included. After non-CNS cases, non-research  studies, non-Cryptococcus, C neoformans species complex,  and C gattii species complex infections were excluded,[10,22–28]  17 studies were reported. Of those 17 studies, 7 were cohort  studies of Cryptococcus,[11,29–34] and 1 study was of C lauren- tii meningitis combined with C albidus cryptococcaemia.[35]  Finally, 9 cases of CNS infections caused by C albidus or its  related species have been reported. The risk factors, mani- festations, diagnosis, and treatment for these pathogens are  presented in table 2. Like other Cryptococcus species, C albi- dus and its related species were commonly isolated from the  gastrointestinal tracts and droppings of birds.[2,36] There is, as  yet, no explanation of how humans contract these infections.  Reasons may include the worldwide increase in immunocom- promised patients, the widespread use of immunosuppressive  agents, and the prolonged use of central venous catheters or  indwelling devices.[9] In our systematic review of the literature,  we detected 2 cases of infection in human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV) infected adults and 4 in apparently immunode- ficient individuals.[3,7,9,38] Leukemia and cancer are important  risk factors in HIV-negative patients.[36,37,39] The administration  of corticosteroids agents, exposure to bird excrement, con- tact with animals, and surgery are also risk factors for these  infections.[2,3,36] Patients can present with headache, fever, altered mental  state, nausea, and vomiting. Headache is the commonest symp- tom, and only 1 patient reported no headache.[7] Although fever  is possible, it only presented in 3 cases (31%). These results are  similar to a cohort study that showed fever present in 28% of  cases.[29] Patients also presented with increased intracranial pres- sure increasing and altered mental states, and these neurolog- ical symptoms are similar to other cryptococcal infections.[28]  The cryptococcal capsule lodges in the arachnoid villi and subsequently prevents CSF reabsorption may explain the ele- vated intracranial pressure.[40] Culture and API® strip assimilation test are laboratory com- monly used methods to identify isolated Cryptococcus spe- cies.[7,38,39] However, it may be difficult to identify species when  only 1 or 2 methods are used. Without the sequence of the D1/ D2 domains of the large-subunit of ribosomal RNA (rRNA),  some rare Cryptococcus species can be misidentified as C albi- dus.[8,27,41] For example, a yeast isolate was initially identified as  C albidus with an API® strip assimilation test. However, after  the internal transcribed spacer and the D1/D2 domains of the  large-subunit rRNA were sequenced, the isolate was finally  confirmed as C liquefaciens.[38] Mass spectrometry is a new  methodology for identifying bacterial species, and some studies  have shown that the accuracy of mass spectrometry for their  identification is over 95% at the species level.[42–44] Hence, the  identification of C albidus based on VITEK mass spectrometry  is reliable. Because these fungi are infrequent causes of disease, there are  no evidence-based guidelines or standard recommendations for  their treatment. The susceptibility of C albidus and its related  species to antifungal agents is shown in Table 3. The cumula- tive experience reported in the published literature suggests that  AmB is the only agent to which C albidus and its related spe- cies are consistently sensitive.[45,46] Therefore, AmB is a safe and  effective drug for use as initial induction therapy against these  infections in the CNS. However, consideration should be given  henceforth to submitting these clinical isolates for susceptibility  testing and proper identification to guide subsequent therapeu- tic decisions. To date, no randomized controlled trials have been  conducted to optimize the choice of AmB or the duration of  its therapy. We recommend: (1) using liposomal-AmB instead  of AmB deoxycholate because liposomal-AmB is safer and  more rapidly sterilizes the CSF than AmB deoxycholate[11,12,32];  (2) at least 1 g of AmB during treatment and prolonged treat- ment are recommended.[47] (3) The combination of AmB and 5-  fluorocytosine, is recommended because it has been shown to  reduce the toxicity of this drug and reduce the relapse rate of C  albidus infections.[30,31] 4.

Based on the systematic review of  CNS infections of C albidus and its related species, we also con- cluded that leukemia and cancer are important risk factors for  these infections and that headache is the most frequent symp- tom. The identification of fungal pathogens requires the analy- sis the rRNA sequences because many species share phenotypic  similarities. AmB-based treatment should be the first choice, and  subsequent treatment should be guided by susceptibility testing. Acknowledgments We thank the patient for participating in this study.

W. A. van Loon 2,3, Luigi Gennaro Izzo 1, Maurizio Iovane 1 &  Giovanna Aronne 1 Understanding the response of plants to varied gravitational conditions is vital for developing  effective food production in space bioregenerative life support systems. This study examines the  impact of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphological responses of Wolffia globosa  (commonly known as “water lentils ” or “duckweed”), assessing its potential as a space crop. Although  an experiment testing the effect of simulated microgravity on Wolffia globosa has been previously  conducted, for the first time, we investigated the effect of multiple gravity levels on the growth  and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa plants. The plant responses to simulated microgravity,  simulated partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity environments were evaluated using random  positioning machines and the large‑diameter centrifuge. As hypothesized, we observed a slight  reaction to different gravitational levels in the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa.  The relative growth rates (RGR) of plants subjected to simulated microgravity and partial gravity  were reduced when compared to those in other gravity levels. The morphological analysis revealed  differences in plant dimensions and frond length‑to‑width ratios under diverse gravity conditions.  Our findings showed that Wolffia globosa is responsive to gravitational changes, with its growth and  morphological adaptations being slightly influenced by varying gravitational environments. As for  other crop species, growth was reduced by the microgravity conditions; however, RGR remained  substantial at 0.33 a day. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a  space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development  of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration  missions. Wolffia globosa, commonly known as “ water lentils ” is a member of the Wolffoideae  subfamily within the Lem - naceae  family, shares similar biological traits with its Lemnoideae  relatives: it is the smallest flowering plant and  shows the fastest growth rate in the plant kingdom and lacks a pseudo root  system1,2. Due to its rapid growth  rate, high protein content, and nutritional value, it has emerged as a promising candidate for sustainable food  production, particularly in agriculturally challenging  regions3–6. This unique plant has recently garnered atten - tion also as a potential bioregenerative life support system (BLSS)  candidate7, offering traits that align with  closed-loop, resource-efficient systems like those adopted for the ESA MELiSSA  Loop8. Nevertheless, as for  other candidate space  crops9,10 to assess the suitability of Wolffia’s  in space cultivation and its ability to recycle  resources efficiently, further laboratory tests investigating growth, nutrition, and genetic responses under extreme  conditions are  fundamental7.OPEN 1Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, Portici, Italy. 2Department Oral and  Maxillofacial Surgery/Pathology, Amsterdam Movement Sciences and Amsterdam Bone Center (ABC), Amsterdam  University Medical Center Location VUmc and Academic Center for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA), Amsterdam,  The Netherlands. 3TEC-MMG-LIS Lab, European Space Agency (ESA) Technology Center (ESTEC), Noordwijk, The  Netherlands. *email: leoneermes.romano@unina.it 2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports  |          (2024) 14:410  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49680-3 www.nature.com/scientificreports/Studying the effects of various stimuli, including different gravity environments, radiations, and their inter - actions, on the growth and development of plants can be challenging and  costly7,11. Space limitations within  onboard test facilities, such as the International Space Station or orbiting vectors, often restrict the number of  replicates, making studies under these conditions even more  demanding12–14. However, cost-effective alternatives  exist in the form of facilities that simulate microgravity and partial gravity levels by continuously altering the  gravitational  vector15–17. These facilities offer higher replicate numbers and serve as robust testbeds for experi - ments involving different gravity  levels18,19. Hypergravity, characterized by gravitational forces greater than Earth’s standard 1 g, is a significant factor in  space exploration, affecting humans, and plant  life20,21. Hypergravity is most prominent during the manuvers of  take-off and landing phases of spacecraft. These brief yet intense episodes of increased gravitational force can  influence various aspects of plant biology and  growth21. Understanding how plants respond to hypergravity is  essential for optimizing their cultivation in space environments and for Earth’s  agriculture22,23. Furthermore, it  provides valuable insights into the mechanisms plants employ to withstand and adapt to extreme gravitational   conditions24,25. Earlier studies under simulated microgravity have shown stable anatomical morphology in Wolffia   plants26,  possible effects of hypergravity on plant growth and reproduction have not yet been investigated. Testing plant  reactions of potential space crops under varying gravity levels, including those experienced during take-off,  landing, or in partial gravities, is reported as  crucial27. Consequently, exploring the adaptability of Wolffia  plants  under different gravitational conditions significantly contributes to our understanding of their  potential7. Recent genome sequencing of Wolffia australiana  has shed light on the gravity-sensing mechanisms and  photomorphogenesis in Wolffia   plants28,29. Due to the loss of gravity sensing genes in the sister species Wolffia  australiana , we also hypothesised for Wolffia globosa a lack of the gravity sensing mechanisms, resulting in a  reduced effect of the different gravity levels on the growth and morphological characteristics. More specifically, we aim to study the effects of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphology  of Wolffia globosa. Leveraging the capabilities of random positioning machines and large-diameter centrifuges,  we simulated microgravity, partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity conditions to comprehensively explore  the impact of varying gravitational environments on this plant species. These machines allow us to generate  and study a range of gravity conditions, thereby elucidating Wolffia globosa’s responses to these diverse gravity  environments and assessing its potential utilisation in space-based food production systems. Materials and methods Plant material and cultivation Plants of Wolffia globosa (9910) have been provided by Prof. Klaus Apperoth from the Department of Plant Physi- ology of the University of Jena, Germany. Upon receive, plant material was surface sterilised with 0.3% bleach/ water solution for 5   min30. After 14 days from disinfection, plants were subcultured for 30 days in N-medium30  under axenic conditions. Therefore, plant material has been transferred under a laminar flow hood in sets of  6-well plates, each filled with 5 ml of N-medium solution and sealed with micropore® tape. Before the experimen- tal run, plants were acclimatised for 24 h at 30 °C. After acclimatisation, an average of 20  ± 4 fronds were trans - ferred in each well of a 6-multiwell plate previously filled with 5 ml of N-medium and 0.8% of Agar to achieve  a semi-solid substrate. The experiment was conducted at 30 ± 0.5 °C average temperature with a photoperiod  of 16/8 h light/dark and a total Photon Flux Density (PFD) of 72.37 ± 10.30 μmol  m−2  s−1 for 168   h2. Carbon  dioxide concentration has been monitored throughout the experiment, resulting in an average concentration  of 303  ± 34 ppm. Hardware description and dimensions Experimental hardware has been developed to hold two multiwell plates in a setup that minimises the gravity gra- dient between the upper and lower multiwell plates. Furthermore, the experimental hardware had to be designed  to fit in most test facilities, setting the lower constraints to an overall dimension of 15*15*15 cm of the smallest  Random Positioning Machine (RPM) available.. Considering these constraints, we designed and developed the  experimental hardware using the free available software SketchUp® (Fig.  1). Due to the constraints described  before, multiwell plates had to be stacked vertically. This setup minimises the distance of the two centres of mass  of both multiwells so that the difference in acceleration can be neglected. The experimental hardware has been  equipped with LED white light (Goming LTD) to ensure proper plant development. Furthermore, 3 cm 5 V fans have been added to the experimental hardware to increase uniformity between the  temperature inside and outside the experimental hardware (Fig.  1). The prototype of the experimental hardware  has been built in plywood. Plywood has been laser cut, and parts have been glued in place with vinyl glue. The  template for laser cutting can be found in supplementary material Appendix A. Nevertheless, the experimental  hardware can be 3D printed in any plastic material, and information for the 3D model can be found on the  directory: GitHub. The inner dimension of each experimental hardware is designed to fit a multiwell plate of standard dimen - sions (12.7  × 8.5 × 2.2 cm). From the multiwell lid to the lighting system, a fixed distance of 2.0 cm has been set  up to guarantee optimal light intensity for plant growth. The experimental hardware’s design and dimensions  are reported below (Fig.  2). Lighting system Light treatment has been achieved utilising two 10 cm 5 V LED stripes illuminating each multiwell plate (Fig.  1).  Via USB connector, the light was connected to a Wi-Fi USB switch that controlled the lighting system and  photoperiod to a 16/8 light/dark cycle. Light emission spectrum has been determined with a spectroradiometer  3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports  |          (2024) 14:410  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49680-3 www.nature.com/scientificreports/(SS-110, Apogee Instruments Inc.) measuring in six different positions within the experimental hardware (N = 6)  in a wavelength range of 340–820 nm. A more detailed composition of the light spectrum is described in Table  1  and Fig.  3. Gravity treatments The study encompassed four different gravity treatments: simulated microgravity, simulated partial gravity  (Moon), and two levels of hypergravity (2 g ad 4g ). In addition, a control group under Earth gravity conditions  was included for comparison (Fig.  4). Simulated microgravity (sim-µg) was achieved using an RPM (Random Positioning Machine, original Dutch  Space Leiden, NL; currently Yuri Space, Meckenbeuren, DE) that allowed the plants to be positioned within  Figure 1.

The RPM was set to a maximum random speed of 60 °/s, minimising residual   acceleration31. RPM was also set to random interval and random direction. Simulated Partial gravity (Moon) (sim-Moon) was simulated using a similar RPM, which was running a dif- ferent program which does not provide a complete random rotation during the experiment but generates vector  orientations and values that are biased such that the averaged resulted gravity vector simulates the Moon. This  proprietary software generated motion can enabled the examination of plant responses to partial gravity ranging  from nearly zero to 0.9 g  levels27. Hypergravity conditions were obtained using the large-diameter centrifuge (LDC)32. Two hypergravity levels  were tested: 2g  and 4 g, corresponding to twice and four times the gravitational force on Earth, respectively. These  conditions allowed investigation of how Wolffia globosa responded to increased gravitational forces. A control group was included, where plants were grown under normal gravity conditions (1g ) in a static  gondola. This control group served as a baseline for comparing the growth and morphology of Wolffia globosa   under different gravity treatments.Table 1.  Light measurements.

Two imaging setups were used: Camera Setup: a Sony Alpha II camera with an 18–70 mm objective was fixed to a camera stand. It captured  top-down images of the multiwell plate placed on a lighting table with a white semi-transparent Polyvinyl chlo - ride panel illuminated by an LED light panel, ensuring uniform lighting conditions. The images thaken with this  setup were used to evaluate growth. Morespecificaly, the relative growth rate (RGR) was calculated by comparing  the area occupied by the plants in pixels at the start of the experiment (t0) and after 168 h (t168). Doubling time  (DT) was determined based on RGR. Stereo Microscope Setup: detailed morphological analysis was performed using a Leica® MZ8 Stereo zoom  Microscope. Images representing replicates for each treatment were captured. Images acquired with the stero - microscope were used to evaluate the morphological traits of Wolffia globosa were compared among gravity  treatments. Morphological traits, such as the dimensions of the long and short axes of the mother fronds, were  measured using Fiji® software. Ratios between the long and short axes of the mother fronds were also calculated  to assess frond roundness. Image analysis has been performed on the images gathered during the experimental run. Two types of analysis  have been conducted: (1) Analysis of the growth parameters (RGR and DT) (2) Analysis of the morphological  differences. RGR has been calculated by comparing the area expressed in pixels occupied by the plant at two-time  intervals (N = 12). Images were analysed using the ilastik® software described by Romano et al.33. We calculated  DT based on RGR as described by  Naumann34. To perform morphological comparison among treatments, one  hundred mother fronds have been randomly selected throughout the different wells of the same multiwell plate  within the same treatment. For coherent results, a phenological standard was determined. We have measured only  mother fronds that had a well-formed daughter frond still attached. Morphological traits have been evaluated  by measuring the long and short side of the mother frond. Long and short side have been always measured as  shown in Fig.  5. Furthermore, we have evaluated the existing ratios with respect to the long side between these  two measurements (N  = 100)26 (Fig.  5). Measurements have been taken utilising Fiji® software. Image analysis data were processed and analysed using SPSS Statistics ver. 21 (IBM Corp.). Differences in  growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa among gravity treatments was assessed by one-way ANOV A  (p < 0.05). Pairwise comparisons were performed using Tukey’s post-hoc test (P  < 0.05) to identify differences  among individual treatments. IUCN policy statement Experimental studies and field research on plants (cultivated or wild), including the collection of plant material,  must comply with relevant institutional, national and international guidelines and legislation. We will strictly  adhere to the IUCN Policy Statement on Research on Endangered Species and the Convention on Trade in  Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Prof. Klaus Apperoth provided specimens in this utilised in this  study from the Department of Plant Physiology of the University of Jena, Germany and are available in the col - lection of the up mentioned university. We confirm compliance with the IUCN policy for plant. Results Relative growth rate (RGR) The analysis of variance (ANOV A) revealed a significant difference (F = 16.47, p  < 0.001) for the RGR among  the different gravity treatments. The Eta-squared and Epsilon-squared effect sizes indicated a large effect of the  treatments on the RGR (Eta-squared = 0.54, Epsilon-squared = 0.51). The post hoc ’Tukey’s test, conducted to  determine the specific differences between the treatments, showed that the simulated microgravity treatment  (sim-µg) (mean difference = 0.33, p < 0.001) had a significantly lower RGR (Fig.  6) compared to the control  treatment (1 g) (mean difference = 0.38 ± 0.02). The simulated Moon partial gravity treatment (sim-Moon g)  also exhibited a lower RGR than the control treatment, but the difference was not statistically significant (mean  difference = 0.36, p = 0.25). In contrast, hypergravity treatments (2 g and 4 g) showed higher RGR compared to the control treatment.  However, there was no significant difference between the control and 2 g hypergravity treatments (mean dif- ference = 0. 38, p = 0.99). The 4 g hypergravity treatment (4 g) showed the highest RGR among all treatments,  Table 2.

Furthermore, the doubling time is reported. The sim-µg treatment exhibited the longest doubling time  of 2.18 days, followed by the sim-Moon g, 1 g, 2 g, and 4 g treatments with doubling times of 1.99, 1.83, 1.82,  and 1.82 days, respectively (Fig.  7). Morphological difference Analysis of the morphological characteristics of Wolffia globosa fronds revealed differences in frond length  among the gravity treatments. Resulting in a variation in the length of both short and long axes. Results of the  ANOV A for the long side length showed a significant difference among gravity treatments (F = 17.34, p  < 0.001).  Results revealed that the fronds in the 1 g treatment exhibited the longest length (mean = 0.76 mm), followed  by the sim-Moon g treatment (mean = 0.76 mm), the sim-µg treatment (mean = 0.75 mm), the 2 g treatment  (mean = 0.73 mm), and the 4 g treatment (mean = 0.71 mm) (Fig.  8). Similarly, for the short side length, a  significant main effect of gravity treatment was found (F  = 5.349, p  < 0.001). Post hoc tests showed that the  fronds in the sim-µg treatment displayed the shortest length (mean  = 0.56 mm), followed by the 4 g treatment  (mean  = 0.57 mm), the sim-Moon g treatment (mean  = 0.57 mm), the 2 g treatment (mean  = 0.58 mm), and the  1 g treatment (mean = 0.59 mm). These results suggest that the gravity environment significantly affects the  MFDF SS LS Figure 5.  Wolffia globosa plant. The dotted line divides the daughter frond (DF) from the mother frond (MF).

Analysis of the ratio in relation to the long side of Wolffia globosa  fronds revealed significant differences  among the different gravity treatments (F = 11.162, p  < 0.001). Post hoc tests reported that the sim-µg treatment  exhibited the highest ratio value (mean = 1.33), followed by the sim-Moon g treatment (mean = 1.32), the 1 g  treatment (mean = 1.30), the 2 g treatment (mean = 1.27), and the 4 g treatment (mean = 1.26).

While  the results revealed some variations in growth and morphological traits among the different gravity treatments,  these observations present exciting opportunities for further exploration and potential applications. In the realm of plant cultivation for space exploration (on orbital platforms, the Moon, and Mars), a more  profound comprehension of plant reactions to altered gravitational conditions is  essential16. Previous studies  have shown various effects of microgravity on the growth of several plant species, but research on the effects of  partial gravity and hypergravity on plants has been  limited15,18. The aid of facilities such as RPMs and LDC can  be the perfect testing ground before experimenting with true  microgravity18,19 and testing the effect of different  gravity levels on the performances of novel space crop  species7. Plants grown under microgravity conditions manifest a slower growth rate compared to those grown under  Earth’s  gravity35. Results from our investigation show that simulated microgravity and simulated Moon gravity  treatments resulted in slightly lower growth rates than the control treatment (Fig.  5). Although these differ - ences, it is important to note that the relative growth rates observed in these treatments were still substantial,  with the simulated microgravity treatment exhibiting a relative growth rate of 0.33 per day and the simulated  Moon partial gravity treatment exhibiting a relative growth rate of 0.36 per day while it was 0.38 per day in the  1 g control plants. In addition, although reduced by the altered gravity conditions, growth rates of the Wolffia   plants remain higher than those typically observed in other higher plant  species36. Results from past experiments  show the relative growth rate over a span of 40 days of lettuce grown under simulated microgravity, yielding a  rate of 0.08/day37. The effects of altered gravity, especially microgravity (whether real or simulated), on higher plant species have  been the subject of numerous scientific  studies38. Wolffia globosa is the smallest higher plant, and its morphology  is entirely distinct from other higher  plants39. It doesn’t exhibit the typical morphology of roots, stems, and leaves  but only has a frond that cannot be associated with any of the three main  organs39. The results of previous studies  on the effects of altered gravity on plant growth are not directly comparable to this species. Most of the research  conducted focuses on the interactions between microgravity and  roots10–12,14,21. Wolffia globosa is famously  known as a rootless  plant39. To further complicate matters, their rootless nature makes comparison with what has  been studied so far challenging. Additionally, while microgravity has often been reported as a limiting growth  factor for  plants40–42, results from tests performed under hypergravity are disagreeing. Studies on the nucleolar  activity or on the elongation of hypocotyls in both Arabidopsis thaliana  and Cucumis sativus, showed a decrease  in growth  rates43,44. At the same time, other results suggest that hypergravity might not affect  growth45. In our  experiment, the 2g  and 4 g hypergravity treatments manifest an increasing (although not statistically significant)  trend in growth rates compared to the control treatment (Fig.  6). This possible positive response to hypergravity  treatments opens up interesting possibilities for future studies and potential applications in space agriculture but  requires new ad hoc tests, eventually applying higher levels of hypergravity to amplify the phenomenon. In such  a scenario, hypergravity conditions could be leveraged to enhance plant productivity and biomass accumulation  in controlled environments, such as space stations. Considering that morphology plays a crucial role in plant growth, survival, and  productivity46, we investigated  the effect of different gravitational treatments on the shape of Wolffia globosa frond. Moreover, results revealed  significant differences among the treatments for both the long and short sides. Worth mentioning that such an  effect occurred on plants that can be considered genetically identical. The study findings revealed that the fronds of Wolffia globosa  were most extended in the 1 g treatment, both  on the front and back sides. Subsequently, the sim-Moon g, sim-µg, 2 g, and 4 g treatments followed in terms of  frond length. These results suggest that both simulated microgravity and simulated Moon’s partial gravity have  don’t have an impact on frond elongation. Furthermore, when analysing the ratio in relation to the longer side,  significant differences were observed among the gravity treatments, indicating distinct frond shapes. The sim-µg  treatment resulted in the most elongated frond shape, followed by the sim-Moon g, 1 g, 2 g, and 4 g treatments.  These findings provide compelling evidence supporting the significant influence of gravity on the morphological  characteristics of Wolffia globosa fronds. The observed variations in frond length and shape among the treat- ments underscore the role of gravity in shaping plant growth and development. Specifically, the sim-µg treatment  consistently induced the most pronounced changes, suggesting its potential as a key factor in determining frond  morphology. These results contribute to our understanding of how different gravity environments impact the  growth and shape of Wolffia globosa, highlighting the importance of considering gravity conditions in cultivating  and manipulating these plants for various space applications. Understanding the underlying mechanisms driving  these morphological changes could provide valuable insights into the plant’s ability to perceive and respond to  gravitational cues. The adaptability of Wolffia globosa  to altered gravity conditions suggested by our data hints at the potential  use of plants from the genus Wolffia  in space agriculture. These plants, characterised by rapid growth and high  nutrient content, are strong candidates for food production in space, where resource constraints are  critical7,13.  Our findings further appraise the possible use of Wolffia globosa  for space exploration and the establishment of  sustainable agriculture in extraterrestrial environments. The robust growth and adaptability to altered gravity  conditions can be added to the small size, rapid growth rate, and high nutrient content, confirming that this genus  deserves consideration for cultivation in limited space and resource-constrained  environments7. Although Wolffia globosa exhibited a reduced growth rate in our experiment under simulated microgravity,  previous research has seen growth enactment of Wolffia globosa under simulated  microgravity26. As already  mentioned by the authors of the up-mentioned work, the enhanced growth might be linked to better utilisa- tion of dissolved oxygen and organic substances in the growth medium due to the type of cultivation system  they have  employed26. The varying responses observed among different gravity treatments in our experiment  9 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports  |          (2024) 14:410  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49680-3 www.nature.com/scientificreports/could be attributed to the interplay between genetic variability within the Lemnaceae family and the specific  environmental conditions experienced by each individual plant. Notably, the genus Wolffia  comprises numer - ous species with significant genetic diversity. Testing the effects of altered gravity on only one clone of Wolffia  globosa , as done in our experiment, provides a valuable starting point but may not fully capture the entire range  of responses within the genus Wolffia . Further investigations involving multiple Wolffia  species and clones are  warranted to explore the full extent of the species’ reaction to altered gravity and better understand the role of  genetic variability in shaping their growth patterns. The recent sequencing of the genome of Wolffia australiana  has provided valuable insights into the genetic  characteristics of Wolffia   species47. One intriguing finding is the absence of gravity-sensing genes commonly  observed in higher plants. More specifically, new findings have shed light on the missing LAZY proteins in  Wolffia australiana28. This genetic difference suggests that Wolffia  species have evolved alternative mechanisms  to perceive and respond to gravity cues, which may explain the distinct growth patterns exhibited under altered  gravitational conditions. Furthermore, to some degree, the enhanced growth rate seen under the hypergravity  treatment could be attributed to gravity resistance genes such as  PTH248. Our results partially confirmed the  expected limited reaction to gravity also of Wolffia globosa. The adaptability of Wolffia globosa to different gravi- tational conditions supported the hypothesis that the loss of gravity-sensing genes reported in the sister species  Wolffia australiana  might also occur in Wolffia globosa. The slight variations in growth rates and morphological  traits observed among the treatments open up interesting avenues for future research and potential applications  in space agriculture. In addition to its implications for space agriculture, this research also contributes to our understanding of  fundamental plant biology. The findings of our experiment might encourage further investigations to clarify  the evolutionary pathways that shaped the peculiar adaptation to gravity associated to a return to an ancestral  aquatic environment of Wolffia  genus.

In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration missions. Due to the loss of gravity sensing genes in the sister species Wolffia australiana , we also hypothesised for Wolffia globosa a lack of the gravity sensing mechanisms, resulting in a reduced effect of the different gravity levels on the growth and morphological characteristics. The different images show the implementation of the experimental hardware in the different gravity treatments.

The study findings revealed that the fronds of Wolffia globosa were most extended in the 1 g treatment, both on the front and back sides.

Weidentify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1 )e n c o d i n ga nE T H Y L E N E - INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative genefor the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2(OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls theproduction of reactive oxygen species i n the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localizatio n of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentlemechanical resistance to root tips, inc luding growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosen sing-induced calcium signaling is required and suf ﬁcient for antagonizing the eth ylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unantici pated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism. The terrestrial colonization of plants is a critical milestone in the Earth ’s evolution history, dramatically increasing the productivity of organic carbon on land to support highly diverse ecosystems1,2.T h e emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a criticalevolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the soil andabsorb water and nutrients 3. Root gravitropism features perception of gravity by the root cap and directional growth regulation mediated byauxin 4. In gravity-oriented roots, symmetrical distribution of auxin in root tips maintain symmetrical growth5. When root growth deviates from the direction of gravity, the amyloplasts in the columella cells ofthe root cap rapidly sink to the plasma membrane at the bottom,triggering the activation of gravity response via LAZY proteins 6,7.S u c h response entails relocation of the auxin exporter PIN-FORMED (PIN) inthe cells and redistribution of auxin8–10, thus promoting asymmetric auxin ﬂow and asymmetric cell growth to bend the root tip to the gravity direction11. Mutations in auxin transporters and gravity- signaling-related proteins often lead to defective root gravitropismduring vertical growth, such as root tips growing toward randomdirections 7,12,13,w a v yr o o t s14, and enlarged root angles15,16. The gaseous plant hormone ethylene plays crucial roles in plant development, senescence, and stress resistance17,18.E t h y l e n eb i o - synthesis and signaling are induced by speci ﬁc conditions or stresses, including ﬂooding, drought, low temperatures, and pathogens18.

When the stress signal fades and the ethylene level goes down, EIN3/EILs are degraded by the EIN3-BINDING F-box protein 1/2 (EBF1/2) mediated ubiquitination/ proteasome pathway27,28. Although ethylene is indispensable for plants, high level of ethy- lene is adverse for root growth29. In compacted soil, diffusion of ethylene away from roots is limited, resulting in the accumulation ofethylene and inhibition of root penetration into the soil 30.E t h y l e n e inhibits root elongation by interacting with other plant hormones,such as auxin and abscisic acid 31. For example, excess ethylene enhances auxin biosynthesis and promotes Auxin Response Factors(ARFs)-mediated transcriptional regulation to affect cell wall compo-sition, thereby limiting the elongation of root cells 32,33. Excess ethylene also weakens root gravitropic response by affecting auxin biosynthesis34,35. In addition, some auxin signaling and transport mutants exhibit both defective gravitropic phenotypes and insensi-tivity to ethylene 36,37. However, the speci ﬁc mechanism whereby ethylene signaling controls gravitropic growth remains unclear. In this study, we isolated an intriguing rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponic culture but normal gravitropic growth insoil. The mutated gene represents a loss-of-function allele for the EIN3-binding F-box protein OsCRW1/OsEBF1, leading to overaccumulationof the OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and ampli ﬁed ethylene signaling. We show that OsEIL1/2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82, which subsequently regulates the transcription of several genes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overaccumulation ofROS in the root tip leads to premature loss of the root cap structure,impaired polar localization of OsPIN2 and auxin distribution, resultingin severely impaired gravitropism. In the soil-grown plants, however,gravitropism is restored in a mechanosensing-induced calciumsignaling-dependent manner, revealing an intricate regulation ofgravitropism by crosstalk between ethylene signaling andmechanosensing. Results crw1 roots coil in water but not in soil We screened an ethyl methylsulfonate-mutagenized population (approximately 5000 lines) of the rice ( Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Zhonghua11 and isolated a mutant with root coiling phenotype wheng r o w ni nh y d r o p o n i cc u l t u r e( F i g . 1a, Supplementary Movie 1). Both seminal and adventitious roots of the mutant coiled in the root tipregion, resulting in a shorter root depth compared to the wild type(WT, Supplementary Fig. 1). Changes in nutrient supply, solution pH,aeration (dissolved oxygen level), and exposure to light did not alterthe root coiling phenotype of the mutant in hydroponic culture(Supplementary Fig. 2). When grown in water-saturated solid media (e.g. paddy soil, soil-vermiculite mixture, vermiculite and peat pellet), however, the root coiling phenotype disappeared (Fig. 1aa n dS u p - plementary Fig. 3). We named the mutant coiling root in water (crw1). In contrast to the distinctive root phenotype, shoots of crw1 grew normally in hydroponics (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Plants were grownto maturity in two paddy ﬁelds. In one paddy ﬁeld, no signi ﬁcant dif- ference was observed between crw1 and WT in any of the agronomic traits determined at plant maturity (Supplementary Fig. 4c –h), whereas in the other ﬁeld there was a small and signi ﬁcant reduction in the percentage of ﬁlled grains and grain biomass per plant in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 4i –n). crw1 exhibits smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and defective gravitropic response in hydroponic T h ec o i l i n gp h e n o t y p eo f crw1 suggests that it may be a gravitropic mutant. Compared with WT, crw1 had a smaller root cap (Fig. 1b) and fewer amyloplasts in the root tip (Fig. 1c). When roots were placedhorizontally, crw1 responded less sensitively to gravity than WT and started to coil at 6 h after horizontal placement (Fig. 1d, e and Sup- plementary Fig. 5), indicating impaired gravitropic response. Auxin distribution is crucial for root gravitropism11.T oe x a m i n e the auxin distribution in the root tip, we introduced the auxin reporter DR5rev::VENUS into WT and crw1. When grown in water (Fig. 1g), WT roots showed symmetrical auxin distribution, whereas crw1 showed asymmetric auxin distribution at different stages of coiling (Fig. 1g). When WT roots were placed horizontally, gravity triggered rapidaccumulation of auxin on the bottom side of the root tip, causing it togrow towards the gravity direction; once the root tip grew in thegravity direction, symmetrical auxin distribution was restored (Sup-plementary Fig. 6a). In contrast, crw1 exhibited an asymmetric auxin distribution at all stages under gravitational stimulation (Supplemen-tary Fig. 6b). As expected, asymmetric auxin distribution led to asymmetric cell length on the two sides of the root tip (Supplementary Fig. 7a –c). Compared to WT, crw1 had a shorter meristem and fewer meristem cells (Supplementary Fig. 7d, e). Staining with 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) showed a lower proliferation of meristem cells incrw1 than WT (Supplementary Fig. 7f, g). Applying the auxin bio- synthesis inhibitor L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn) or removing the root capresulted in a more even auxin distribution (indicated by DR5rev::VE- NUS) and rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplemen- tary Fig. 8). InArabidopsis thaliana , symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip is maintained by the auxin exporter PIN2, which is polarly localized on the top of the root epidermal cells to allow the shootward ﬂow of auxin from the root tip 12. This pattern of polar localization is conserved in seed plants3. To examine the localization of OsPIN2 in the root tip, we introduced OsPIN2-GFP driven by its native promoter ( pOsPI- N2::OsPIN2-GFP )i n t oW Ta n d crw1 by crossing. OsPIN2-GFP was polarly localized in the epidermal cells in WT, whereas such polarity was lost incrw1 (Fig. 1h), which is consistent with the asymmetric auxin dis- tribution observed in crw1 root tips. When grown in soil, all phenotypes of the mutant, including root coiling, root cap size, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, andgravity response, were rescued to similar levels observed in WT (Fig. 1a–h and Supplementary Fig. 5). Taken together, these data sug- gest that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water is caused by a smaller root cap size with fewer amyloplasts and asymmetric auxindistribution resulted from OsPIN2 mis-localization. Cloning the causative gene of crw1 To clone the causal gene for the crw1 phenotype, we backcrossed WT (paternal) with crw1 (maternal). All F 1plants showed the straight-root phenotype in water (Supplementary Fig. 9a), and the F 2progeny seg- regated into 340 and 119 straight and coiling-root, respectively, whichis consistent with a 3:1 ratio ( χ 2= 0.002, P= 0.966) (Supplementary Fig. 9b), indicating that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 resulted from recessive mutation of a single gene. We conducted genomicresequencing mapping and Mut-Map analysis on the F 2progeny and identi ﬁed three candidate genes, Os06g0604400 ,Os06g0605900 , and Os06g0619600 (Supplementary Fig. 9c, d). Complementation tests identi ﬁedOs06g0605900 as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype, which we name COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (OsCRW1) (Fig. 2a–d and Supplementary Fig. 9e, f). Compared to WT, a 3681-bp fragment deletion was identi ﬁed in the promoter and a portion of the open reading frame of crw1 allele, resulting in a total loss of tran- scription (Fig. 2a, b). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of OsCRW1 (oscrw1KO) in WT also generated the same root coiling phenotype in water, which disappeared in soil (Fig. 2e, f and Supplementary Fig. 10a). The three oscrw1KOlines also showed smaller root caps and asymmetric auxin distribution in the root tips when grown in water, and thesedefective phenotypes were rescued when plants were grown in soil(Supplementary Fig. 10b, c).Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Nature Communications |         (2025) 16:3712 2 Analysis of transgenic plants expressing pOsCRW1::GFP and pOsCRW1::GUS showed that OsCRW1 was expressed in both roots and shoots (Fig. 2g ,ha n dS u p p l e m e n t a r yF i g .1 1 ) .I nr o o t s , OsCRW1 was strongly expressed in root tips, especially in the root cap (Fig. 2g, h).

To examine whether loss of function of OsEBF2 affects gravitropism, we knocked out OsEBF2 in the WT background using CRISPR/Cas9. No effect on root growth and gravitropism wasfound (Supplementary Fig. 12a, b). Knockout of OsEBF2 incrw1 did not exacerbate the root coiling phenotype in water, and also did not affectthe phenotype recovery in soil (Supplementary Fig. 12c, d), suggestingthat OsEBF2, unlike OsCRW1/OsEBF1, does not play a role in rootgravitropism. We performed RNA-seq analysis on WT and crw1 roots grown in water or soil. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs)between crw1 and WT grown in water, ethylene-responsive genes were strongly enriched, with 30 of the 32 DEGs being signi ﬁcantly upregu- lated in crw1, including 20 ethylene response transcription factors (ERFs) (Fig. 3a, b). When grown in soil, the number of DEGs between crw1 and WT decreased to 5, with 2 ethylene-related genes being upregulated in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 13). Application of 1-MCP, an ethylene response inhibitor, totally rescuedthe phenotypes of smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution androot coiling in crw1 and three oscrw1 KOlines in water (Fig. 3c–f), sug- gesting that excessive ethylene response leads to the root coiling phenotype. The above ﬁndings support the notion that OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may, likeArabidopsis AtEBF1, function in the degradation of core ethylene response transcription factors27,28. These may include OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that are rice homologs of AtEIN3/EIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 14a),the central transcriptional factors controlling the activation of ethy-lene signaling and targets of AtEBF1 41,42. We investigated whether OsCRW1 interacts with OsEIL1/OsEIL2 proteins. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H)and bimolecular ﬂuorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that OsCRW1 physically interacted with OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 (Supple-mentary Fig. 14b, c).

In contrast, WT roots grown in a highly compactedsoil (bulk density = 1.6 g cm −3) exhibited an elevated level of OsEIL1, indicating an increased ethylene consistent with the report by Pandey et al.30Next, we knocked out OsEIL1 (oseil1KO/crw1 )o rOsEIL2 (oseil2KO/ crw1)i ncrw1 by using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplementary Fig. 14d, e), which essentially rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water (Fig. 4c, d), with the effect being greater in oseil1KO/crw1 than in oseil2KO/crw1 . These results indicate that loss of function of OsCRW1/ OsEBF1 leads to overaccumulation of both OsEIL1 and OsEIL2, causingthe root coiling phenotype in water, with OsEIL1 playing a larger rolethan OsEIL2. Next, we overexpressed OsEIL1 orOsEIL2 driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter, increasing the transcription of the two genes by 16-22- and 52-57-fold, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 16a, b). When grown in water, OsEIL1 andOsEIL2 overexpressing lines showed shorter and slightly curved roots compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 16c).Addition of a small dose of the ethylene precursor ACC (1 μM) in water decreased root growth of WT slightly but caused OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines to coil in the root tip region, a phenotyperesembling crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 16d). Overexpression of OsEIL1 orOsEIL2 alone did not cause root coiling, likely because OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 is degraded in the presence of functional OsCRW1/OsEBF1. Incontrast, enhanced ethylene concentration from ACC addition mayrepress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and thus stabilize OsEIL1and OsEIL2 proteins, as has been shown in Arabidopsis 43.W h e ng r o w n in soil, the shorter and curvy roots of OsEIL1 andOsEIL2 overexpressing lines were largely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 16e). OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82 To search for the direct target genes downstream of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2that cause root coiling in crw1, we analyzed the expression pattern of all of the 139 ERFgenes from the transcriptomic data. We expected that the transcriptional levels of the target genes should match the phe-notype changes, i.e. elevated in crw1 only in water but reduced in soil. When grown in water, 20 ERFgenes were expressed at higher levels in crw1 roots than WT (Supplementary Fig. 17a). When grown in soil, 17 of these 20 ERFgenes were equally highly expressed in both WT and crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 17b), suggesting that these 17 ERFgenes may not be related to the root coiling phenotype of crw1. The three remaining ERFgenes, OsERF2 (Os06g0181700 ),OsERF81 (Os02g0520000 )a n d OsERF82 (Os04g0399800 )w e r es i g n i ﬁcantly downregulated in both WT and crw1 when grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 17b). These ERF genes are potential candidate genes targeted by OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 andassociated with the occurrence of the root coiling phenotype (Sup-plementary Fig. 17b, c and Fig. 4e). We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the three ERF genes individually in the crw1 background (Supple- mentary Fig. 17d –f) and found that disruption of OsERF82 (oserf82 KO/ crw1) rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water to a large extent (Fig. 4f, g), whereas knockout of OsERF2 orOsERF81 had no effect (Supplementary Fig. 17g, h). The OsERF82 protein was localizedin the nucleus and exhibited transactivation activity (SupplementaryFig. 18a, b). We used yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoreticmobility shift assay (EMSA) to demonstrate that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2could speci ﬁcally bind to the EIN3-binding sites (EBS, ATGTA) in the promoter region (2.5 Kb) of OsERF82 (Fig. 4h–j and Supplementary Fig. 18c). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR of pOsEIL1::O- sEIL1-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 transgenic plants showed that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 bound to the EBS sequences in theOsERF82 promoter in vivo (Fig. 4k, l). Furthermore, knockout of OsEIL1 orOsEIL2 incrw1 largely abolished the upregulation of OsERF82 expression when grown in water (Fig. 4m). Taken together, the tran- scription factor OsERF82 acts as a direct target of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 toamplify ethylene signaling and cause root coiling of crw1 in water.T h ec o m p l e t er e s c u eo ft h e crw1 phenotype in oseil1/crw1 but the incomplete rescue in oserf82 KO/crw1 suggests that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also be involved. OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS nexus controls gravitropism In addition to the ethylene signaling pathway, RNA-seq showed thatgenes related to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were alsoenriched in crw1 when grown in water but not in soil (Fig. 3aa n d Supplementary Fig. 19a), suggesting that ROS may be involved in theroot coiling phenotype. Among the DEGs between crw1 and WT, a ROS- responsive gene Bsr-d1/ZFP36 , a respiratory burst oxidase homolog enzyme gene ( RBOHH ) and four class III peroxidase genes were upre- gulated in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 19b). It has been shown OsRBOHH is involved in ROS production in rice roots 44. The Class III peroxidases are also possibly involved in ROS production in multiple and func- tionally redundant ways45. To examine whether ROS is involved in the root coiling phenotype, we used the ROS ﬂuorescent probe H 2DCFDA to monitor root ROS levels in WT and crw1 grown in water. Compared with WT, the ROS level in the root tips of crw1 was elevated dramati- cally, especially in the coiling region and the sloughing root cap cells(Fig. 5a). Aeration of hydroponic solution had no effect on the ROS level in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 20). When grown in soil or vermi- culite, ROS in crw1 roots returned to a low level comparable to that in WT, corresponding to the recovery of the root phenotype (Supple-mentary Fig. 19c, d). Increased programmed cell death was observed inthe root cap cells of crw1 grown in water by the TUNEL assay (Fig. 5b), which was likely induced by excess ROS 46and explained why crw1 had a smaller root cap than WT. Application of the ROS scavengerN-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), the RBOH inhibitor diphenyleneio- donium (DPI, 50 nM), or the inhibitor of the class III peroxidase sali-cylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) in water reduced ROS in crw1 roots to the level comparable to that in WT (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 19e, f), prevented the excessive programmed cell death andsloughing of the root cap cells, and largely rescued the root coilingphenotype (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 19g, h). Furthermore, clearance of ROS restored the polar localization of OsPIN2 and sym-metric distribution of auxin in the root tips of crw1 (Fig. 5d, e). Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced ROS generation, likely by RBOHs and PRXs, causes root coiling in crw1 by accelerating sloughing of root cap cells and impairing OsPIN2 localization. To establish the causal relationship between excess ROS and the ampli ﬁed OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 roots, we grew WT, crw1, oseil1 KO/crw1 lines, oseil2KO/crw1 lines, and oserf82KO/crw1 lines in water and examined the ROS level in root tips. Knockout of OsEIL1 ,OsEIL2 ,o r OsERF82 incrw1 decreased ROS to a similar level as in WT (Fig. 5f–h), suggesting that the ampli ﬁed OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 leads to excessive ROS generation in the root tip. To explore howenhanced OsERF82 promotes ROS production, we found that the promoter regions (approximately 3 Kb) of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Os09g0323700, Os06g06 95400 and Os07g0638600) contain potential ERF binding sites, including DRE/CRT (GCCGAC),GCC-box (GCCGCC) and G-box (CACGTG) 47(Supplementary Fig. 21a). The Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay(EMSA) demonstrated that OsERF82 speci ﬁcally bound to the binding sites of the DRE/CRT, GCC-box and G-box in the promoter region ofOsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the transcriptional levels of OsRBOHH and the three Class III OsPRX genes were upregulated in crw1 root tips compared with those in WT (Supplementary Fig. 21d), whereasknockout of OsEIL1 ,OsEIL2 orOsERF82 incrw1 suppressed the upre- gulation of these genes (Supplementary Fig. 21d). Taken together, ampli ﬁed OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 causes ROS accumulation in crw1 root tips likely by promoting the transcription of OsRBOHH and Class III OsPRX genes.Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Nature Communications |         (2025) 16:3712 7 Mechanical resistance on the root tip rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 After identifying ampli ﬁed ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/2- OsERF82 leading to ROS overproduction as the cause of impairedgravitropism in crw1, we explored the mechanism underlying the res- cue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 when plants were grown inwater-saturated paddy soil and other solid media (Supplementary Fig. 3).

These results suggestthat a gentle mechanical resistance of ≥34 Pa is suf ﬁcient to rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1. To further examine the effect of mechanical resistance, we attached a polystyrene foam pellet (1-mm diameter) to the root tip ofcrw1 grown in water, which applied a mechanical stimulus to the root tip through the buoyance of water against the foam pellet (Fig. 6d). The pellet was open at the top to allow normal gas diffusion. Theresistance of the foam pellet to the root tip was estimated to beapproximately 104 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 23). The attachment offoam pellet did not affect the root cap size and symmetric auxin dis-tribution in WT, but largely rescued the root cap size, auxin distribu-tion and the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 24 and Fig. 6e, f), indicating that the root tip is the site for sensing mechanical stimulus which rescues the loss of gravitropism in crw1. Soil compaction may restrict ethylene diffusion away from plant roots, thus amplifying ethylene signaling and inhibiting root growth 30. We compared root growth of WT and crw1 in a paddy soil packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3)a n dah i g h( 1 . 6gc m−3) bulk density. Both levels of bulk density restored the coiling root phenotype of crw1 to straight roots. At 1.0 bulk density, WT, crw1 and two oscrw1KOmutants showed similar root length (Supplementary Fig. 25). Increasing bulk density to1.6 decreased the root length of WT by 36% and of crw1 and two oscrw1 KOmutants by 47-51% (Supplementary Fig. 25). The larger inhi- bition in crw1 is consistent with the heightened ethylene signaling. Mechanosensing rescuing crw1 phenotype requires calcium signaling in the root cap Calcium (Ca2+) is a critical signal in plant responses to mechanical stimuli48,49.T oi n v e s t i g a t ew h e t h e rC a2+signaling is involved in the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1,w ee x p r e s s e d NES- YC3.650, a cytosolic Ca2+([Ca2+]cyt) reporter gene, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter in WT and then introduced the gene into crw1 through crossing. The root caps of both WT and crw1 growing in four different solid media showed a signi ﬁcantly higher [Ca2+]cytsignal than those growing in water, and there were no signi ﬁcant differences between WT and crw1 (Fig. 7a, b). Similarly, the [Ca2+]cytsignal remained low in the root caps of both WT and crw1 when grown in 0.3% and 0.4% agar, and increased signi ﬁcantly when both were grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Supplementary Fig. 26). These results suggest that agentle mechanical resistance of approximately ≥34 Pa enhances [Ca 2+]cytin the root cap and beyond this threshold there is no further increase in [Ca2+]cyt. Moreover, loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 does not affect [Ca2+]cytin the root cap or its response to mechanical resistance. To investigate whether the enhanced Ca2+signal in the root cap is involved in the recovery of crw1 ’s phenotypes, we applied 100 μM LaCl 3,aC a2+channel blocker, to 0.8% agar. We found that LaCl 3sup- pressed [Ca2+]cytin the root caps (Fig. 7c, d) and largely abolished the rescue effect of mechanical resistance on the root cap size and auxindistribution (Fig. 7e, f). Importantly, the addition of LaCl 3abolished the recovery of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Fig. 7g and Supplementary Fig. 27), indicating the root cap calcium signal triggered by mechanosensing is required for the rescue ofgravitropism in crw1. The observation that growing in soil prevented overaccumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in crw1 roots (Fig. 4a, b) suggests that mechanosensing-Ca 2+signaling may rescue the root coiling phenotype ofcrw1 by limiting the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 when grown in 0.4% agar, and accumulation of the two proteins was sup-pressed to the WT levels when grown in 0.8% agar (Fig. 7h, i). Addition of 100 μML a C l 3to 0.8% agar suppressed [Ca2+]cytin the root caps, r e s u l t i n gi na no v e r - a c c u m u l a t i o no fO s E I L 1a n dO s E I L 2i nt h e crw1roots (Fig. 7h, i). There were no signi ﬁcant differences in the transcript levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 between WT and crw1 in different agar concentrations or between 0.8% agar with and without addition ofLaCl 3(Supplementary Fig. 28), su ggesting that the effect of mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling on the protein levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 is not related to transcriptional regulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 . Furthermore, upregulation of OsERF82 and excess ROS pro- duction in crw1 roots were observed when grown in 0.4% agar but not in 0.8% agar, whereas the addition of LaCl 3to 0.8% agar medium sig- niﬁcantly increased OsERF82 transcription and ROS accumulation in crw1 roots (Fig. 7j and Supplementary Fig. 29). In WT roots, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins were kept at low levels because of the presence ofOsCRW1, which likely explains the lack of response of OsERF82 tran- scription and ROS level to mechano-sensing induced Ca 2+signaling in WT. These results suggest that mechano-sensing induced Ca2+signal- ing inhibits the ampli ﬁed module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS in crw1, and rescues the root cap structure, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and consequently gravitropism. The root coiling phenotype in hydroponics occurs in natural rice accessions Rice roots show considerable natural variation in the growth pheno- type when grown in hydroponics. During the screen of a panel of 230rice accessions consisting mainly of landraces in the lower YangtzeRiver delta in China, we found that 53, 46 and 131 accessions exhibitedthe root coiling, straight root, and intermediate phenotypes, respec- tively, when grown in water (Supplementary Fig. 30a). We randomly selected 8 accessions each with coiling or straight roots (Supplemen-tary Fig. 30b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the group of rootcoiling accessions had a signi ﬁcantly lower level of OsCRW1 transcript than the group with straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30d). Additionof 1-MCP to water straightened the coiling roots (SupplementaryFig. 30e), suggesting the phenotype in these rice accessions is likelycaused by enhanced ethylene signaling. When grown in water-saturated paddy soil, the root coiling phenotype was completely res-cued (Supplementary Fig. 30f), which is consistent with the phenotyperecovery of crw1. In highly compacted soil, coiling-root accessions showed shorter root elongation than straight-root accessions, which is consistent with the phenotypes of crw1 and WT, respectively (Sup- plementary Fig. 30g). Discussion Ethylene plays a critical role in plant growth, development and resis-tance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Because ethylene bio-synthesis ﬂuctuates widely under the in ﬂuence of changing environments 18,51, its effect on gravitropic growth of roots must be tightly regulated. In this study, by dissecting the genetic basis for theroot coiling phenotype in the rice mutant crw1, we uncovered the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1)-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots (Fig. 8). Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescuedroot coiling phenotype of crw1, we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling,thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig. 8). The gravitropic growth of roots depends on the perception of gravity by the root cap and the symmetric distribution of auxin in theroot tip. The former requires amyloplast as the gravity responder totransmit the gravity signal via LAZY proteins 6,7, and the latter is tightly controlled by polar-localized auxin transporters such as PIN212.M u t a - tions of critical genes in auxin transport (e.g. pin212,aux113,eir136), amyloplast synthesis52,53and gravity signaling6,7cause plant roots to display defective gravitropic behaviors during vertical growth. Theimpact of ethylene signaling on root gravitropism appears to varyamong plant species. In Arabidopsis , loss-of-function mutations of the key genes that control ethylene biosynthesis or signal transduction,Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Nature Communications |         (2025) 16:3712 10 including ETO1 ,CTR1, EIN2, andEIN3, did not affect gravitropic growth of roots35. In contrast, disruption of EIL1andEIN2 homologous genes in rice or maize resulted in enlarged angle of adventitious roots when grown in hydroponic, indicating a weakened gravitropism35.I nt h e present study, we found that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led tocoiling of both seminal and adventitious roots of rice in hydroponicculture, indicative of a severe disruption of gravitropism. The F-boxproteins EBFs bind to EIN3 and EIL proteins, thus promoting theirdegradation via a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway 27,28. The loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to overaccumulation of OsEIL1/2proteins in rice roots and consequently ampli ﬁed ethylene signaling. We identi ﬁed OsERF82, a hitherto unreported ethylene response fac- tor, as the downstream target of OsEIL1/2. OsERF82 transcriptionallyregulates the expression of several genes involved in ROS production,including OsRBOHH and several Class III peroxidase genes.

Apart from OsERF82, it is possible that other target genesregulated by OsEIL1 may also play a small role in the coiling root phenotype of crw1. We found that excessive ROS accumulation in the root tip of crw1 accelerates root cap sloughing through programed cell death, therebyreducing the number of amyloplast and weakening gravity perception.Furthermore, excessive accumulation of ROS disrupted the symme-trical auxin distribution in the root tip by impairing the polar locali-zation of OsPIN2. This is consistent with an earlier ﬁnding that application of exogenous H 2O2inhibits vesicle-mediated traf ﬁcking and polar localization of AtPIN2 in Arabidopsis54. Disrupted polar localization of OsPIN2 and reduced root cap stability together explainthe severe loss of gravitropism in crw1 roots. Thus, limiting ethylene signaling in the nucleus is critical for the normal gravitropic growth of rice roots. Although growing in compacted soil may increase the ethylene level in roots due to restricted gas diffusion 30, we found that gentle mechanical resistance that rice roots typically encounter in water-saturated paddy soil or other soft solid media enhances the degra-dation of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 and thus dampens the excessive ethylenesignaling in crw1 , leading to rescue of the root coiling phenotype. The mechanical resistance required to antagonize ethylene signal-ing ampli ﬁcation is mild (penetration resistance ≥34 Pa), consistent with the soft nature of submerged paddy soil that rice plants areadapted to. This level of mechanical resistance is more than an order of magnitude lower than in water unsaturated and compacted soil used in the study of Pandey et al. 30. Strong mechanical resistance can inhibit root elongation or change the direction of root growth. Forexample, root tips stop growing when encountering three-dimensional impenetrable compactness 30, change direction toavoid a ﬂat obstacle55, or grow in a wavy or circular manner on an impenetrable agar slope56–58. A recent study showed that Arabidopsis roots growing on the agar surface can produce different growth paths in response to subtle changes of mechanical forces59. In the present study, mild mechanical resistance did not affect the normalroot growth of WT but was suf ﬁcient to ensure gravitropic root growth of crw1 and coiling-root accessions, suggesting that mechanical resistance below the level that inhibits root growth canbe sensed by rice roots to help safeguard gravitropism. Such aneffect has not been reported before but is consistent with previousﬁndings that plants can sensitively perceive different strengths of mechanical stimuli from nature and produce rapid thigmonasticresponses or gradual morphogenetic alterations 60,61. We found that the rescue of root gravitropism in crw1 by gentle mechanical resistance requires Ca2+signaling in the root cap. In the absence of OsCRW1/OsEBF1, mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling safeguards the gravitropic growth of crw1 roots by suppressing the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. How enhanced Ca2+signaling in the root cap prevents over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2remains unclear and warrants further investigation. The observationthat knockout of OsEBF2 incrw1 d i dn o ta f f e c tt h er e s c u eo ft h er o o t coiling phenotype by gentle mechanical resistance suggests thatenhanced Ca 2+signaling promotes the degradation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in an OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and OsEBF2-independentmechanism. Mechanosensing-induced Ca 2+signaling may play a parti- cularly important role in keeping ethylene signaling in check under stress conditions, which suppress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF143, or in natural rice accessions with a weak or loss-of-function OsCRW1.On the other hand, although OsCRW1 may be dispensable in uncom-pacted soil, it is needed to restrict excessive ethylene signaling incompacted soil to reduce the inhibition on root growth.Fig. 7 | Mechanosensing induced Ca2+signaling antagonizes ethylene signaling to maintain root gravitropism in crw1. a,bWT and crw1 (both expressing NES- YC3.6 ) were grown in water or different soil for 2 days. aThe NES-YC3.6 ﬂuores- cence in the root caps. bQuanti ﬁcation of NES-YC3.6 ﬂuorescence in the root caps. c–jWT and crw1 expressing various reporters were grown in 0.4% and 0.8% agar with or without 100 μML a C l 3for 2−3d a y s .( c) Cytosolic Ca2+in the root caps detected by NES-YC3.6. dQuanti ﬁcation of NES-YC3.6 intensity. eLugol ’ss t a i n i n g of root caps. fDR5rev::VENUS ﬂuorescence of root tips. gRoot phenotypes. h,iLevel of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in WT and crw1 roots by immunoblot.OsEIL1-Flag and OsEIL2-Flag proteins were detected by Flag antibody (anti-Flag) and the Actin (anti-Actin) was used as a loading control. jTranscriptional level of OsERF82 in roots by Q-PCR.

Fig. 8 | A model of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing inhibiting ethylene signaling to maintain root gravitropism. The presence of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing of root tips maintains root gravitropism in soil. OsCRW1 and the mechanosensing induced Ca2+signaling inhibit the ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82 to control ROS homeostasis in root tips, consequently maintaining the structural stability of root cap and polar localization of OsPIN2, ultimately ensuringgravitropism in rice roots. Some components of this Figure were creased with Adobe Illustrator ( https://helpx.adobe.com/cn/support/illustrator.html ).Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Nature Communications |         (2025) 16:3712 12 Interestingly, we observed that the root coiling phenotype was present in some natural rice accessions when grown in hydroponics,and the phenotype was apparently related to the transcription level ofOsCRW1/OsEBF1 . Some of the coiling-root accessions had a OsCRW1/ OsEBF1 transcript level similar to those in the straight-root accessions, s u g g e s t i n gt h a tv a r i a t i o ni nt h ep r o t e i nl e v e lo ri nt h ec o d i n gs e q u e n c emay also be involved. Growing these rice accessions in soft paddy soilalso restored their gravitropic growth. A lower level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may be advantageous for stress resistance because ofenhanced ethylene signaling, especially when root gravitropic growthcan be safeguarded by mechanosensing. Several stress responsepathways were enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs)between crw1 and WT (Fig. 3b). Among these DEGs, at least 24 genes that were upregulated in crw1 have been previously reported to be involved in the resistance to drought, salinity, cold, or diseases (Sup- plemental Fig. 31). Evolution of land plants is accompanied with expansion of genes involved in hormone signaling and transcriptionfactors 62. Our study shows that mechanosensing induced Ca2+signal- ing plays an unexpected role in balancing the ethylene-auxin signalingpathways for gravitropic growth of plants in soil. Methods Plant materials and growth conditions The japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua11 was used as the wild type (WT)for all experiments. An ethyl methylsulfonate (EMS)-mutagenizedpopulation (M3 generation) was used for root phenotype screening. Transgenic plant materials were generated as described below. Seeds were surface sterilized with 15% NaClO for 30 min, washed withsterilized water, and placed in a 37 °C incubator for 2 days to pro-mote germination. Germinated seeds were transferred to hydro-ponic boxes, soil culture boxes or agar plates to grow depending onthe requirements of different experiments. Experiments were carriedout in a growth room with the following conditions: temperature 28°C ± 0.5 °C, humidity 50% –60%, 12-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 100 mmol of photons m −2s−1. WT and mutant were also grown in two paddy ﬁelds (Nanjing and Sanya) to maturity. Agro- nomic traits, including plant height, tiller number, percentage of ﬁlled grains, 1000-grain weight and grain biomass per plant, were determined at plant maturity. Plasmid construction and plant transformation The CRISPR/Cas9 system63was used to knock out OsCRW1 (Os06g0605900 )a n d OsEBF2 (Os02g0200900 )i nt h eZ h o n g h u a 1 1 background and OsEBF2 ,OsEIL1 (Os03g0324200 ), OsEIL2 (Os07g0685700 ),OsERF2 (Os06g0181700 ),OsERF81 (Os02g0520000 ), and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800 )i nt h e crw1 background. Two 20-bp target sequences were selected from the coding sequence (CDS) ofeach gene and cloned into two single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes of pYLgRNA-OsU6a and pYLgRNA-OsU6b by overlapping PCR, producing proU6a-T1-sgRNA and proU6b-T2-sgRNA fragments, respectively. The two fragments were sequentially cloned into theBsaI site of the pYLCRISPR-Cas9Pubi-H vector to generate the ultimate plasmids. To generate the complementation constructs of proOsCR- W1::OsCRW1 ,proOs06g0604400:: Os06g0604400 and proOs06- g0619600::Os06g0619600 ,w ea m p l i ﬁed the promoter (1739 bp of proOsCRW1 ,3K bo f proOs06g0604400 and 3 Kb of proOs06g0619600 ) and the open reading frame (ORF) of OsCRW1 ,Os06g0604400 and Os06g0619600 from the DNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and ORF were cloned together by overla p p i n gP C Ra n di n t r o d u c e di n t o t h eE c o R I / X b a Is i t eo ft h e pCAMBIAL1301 vector. To generate proOsCRW1::GFP constructs, we ampli ﬁed the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11and the GFP sequence from thepUN1301 vector with addition of the initiation codon. The promoter and GFP sequence were cloned together by overlapping PCR and intro-duced into the HindIII/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. To generatepOsCRW1::GUS constructs, we ampli ﬁed the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced OsCRW1 pro- moter into the HindIII/BamHI site of the p1300 vector. To generate proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag and proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag constructs, we ampli ﬁed the promoter (2588 bp of proOsEIL1 ,2 5 0 0 b po f proOsEIL2 ) and the full-length CDS (without the stop codon) of OsEIL1 andOsEIL2 from the DNA and cDNA of Zhonghua 11. The promoter and CDS were cloned together by overlapping P CR and introduced into the BamHI/ SpeI site of the pTCK303 vector. To generate proUbi::OsEIL1 (OsEIL1-OX) andproUbi::OsEIL2 (OsEIL2-OX) constructs, we ampli ﬁed the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 andOsEIL2 from the cDNA of cv. ZH11 and introduced the CDS segments into the BamHI/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. The plasmids were transformed into the callus of Zhonghua11 or crw1 using Agrobacterium -mediated transformation64. Transformants were veri ﬁed by PCR. All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Zhonghua11 expressing DR5rev::VENUS65,proOsPIN2::OsPIN2- GFP14,o r NES-YC3.665were obtained from previous studies. These genotypes and Zhonghua11 expressing proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag were crossed with crw1 oroscrw1KOlines (maternal) to obtain the reporter or tag lines in the mutant backgroundby PCR. The F3 seeds were used for experiments. Root growth experiments Germinated seeds were placed on a net ﬂoating on deionized water for ten days and then transferred to ½ strength Kimura B nutrient solution66for different durations according to the requirements of experiments. The nutrient solution was changed every three days, andthe pH was maintained at 5.6-5.8. To investigate the effects of nutri-ents, pH, light and dissolved oxygen level on root phenotypes, we grewseedlings of crw1 and WT in hydroponic boxes ﬁlled with deionized water or nutrient solution at the ¼ and ½ strength, different solutionpH (from 4 to 8), light condition (12 h/12 h light/dark or 24 h dark), withor without aeration treatment (dissolved oxygen level 12.45 and5.36 mg/L, respectively). To compare the root phenotypes grown inwater and solid media, we grew germinated seedlings in water (pH =5.6-5.8), water-saturated paddy soil, water-saturated vermiculite or water-saturated peat pellet for 2-10 days. Dissolved oxygen con- centrations in hydroponic solution and soil were measured using adissolved oxygen probe. In some experiments, paddy soil was packedat a normal (1.0 g cm −3)a n dah i g h( 1 . 6 g c m−3) bulk density. The penetration resistance of soil and other solid growth media was mea-sured by using a soil compactness tester. To investigate the effect of mechanical resistance on root pheno- types, we grew seedlings of WT and crw1 in agar-solidi ﬁed medium with 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 or 1.2% (w/ v) agar in square Petri dishes. The top 2-cm agar was removed and the emerged seminal roots (1-2 mm)of WT and crw1 were embedded in the agar and allowed to grow verti- cally for 2 to 3 days. To apply resistance on root tips, we made polystyrene foam spherical pellets (1 mm diameter) with a slit in themiddle, placed root tip into the slit and grew seedlings in deionizedwater for 2-3 days. For chemical treatment, L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn, 10 μM), 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP, 10 μM), 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic Acid (ACC, 1 μM), N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), diphenyleneiodo- nium (DPI, 50 nM), salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) or LaCl 3 (100μM )w e r ea d d e dt od e i o n i z e dw a t e ro ra g a rm e d i u ma c c o r d i n gt o different experiments. Each genotype and treatment had at least 3 bio-logical replicates, 7-12 plants per replicate in short-term hydroponicexperiments, 3-6 plants per replicate in long-term hydroponic experi-ments, 3-4 plants per replicate in petri dish experiments, and 7-12 plants per replicate in soil-vermiculite experiments. MutMap-based gene cloning To clone the causal gene responsible for the coiling-root phenotype of crw1, we backcrossed crw1 to WT (Zhonghua11) to generate F 1Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Nature Communications |         (2025) 16:3712 13 progenies. F 1progenies were selfed to generate F 2progenies. DNA was extracted from 50 F 2plants showing the coiling-root phenotype in water and mixed in equal proportions to generate a pooled genomicDNA of crw1. A pooled genomic DNA of WT was prepared in the same way. Genome sequencing was performed using Illumina Hiseq4000 at 5 0 ×a n d3 0 ×c o v e r a g ef o r crw1 and WT, respectively), generating 150- bp paired-end reads. After removing the adapter sequences and low-quality reads, clean reads were mapped to the reference genomesequence (OsNipponbare-Reference-RGAP7, MSU) using BWAsoftware 67, followed by SNP-calling using GATK software68. Causative v a r i a n tw e r ec a l c u l a t e du s i n gt h eM u t M a pS N P - i n d e xm e t h o d69and candidate SNPs were identi ﬁed. Tissue expression pattern analysis of OsCRW1 Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GUS were grown in water for 3 days before being used for histochemical staining for the GUS activity in roots, and in nutrient solution for different durationsfor GUS staining of leaves and reproductive organs. Roots and othertissues were incubated with a GUS staining solution for 2 h at 37 °C,transferred to 70% ethanol overnight, and then photographed underan ultra-depth stereoscopic microscope (Leica, DVM6a). Transgenicrice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GFP were grown in water for 3 days and roots were cut and were placed on a slide for ﬂuorescence imaging under a macro zoom microscope (Carl Zeiss, MVX10). The GFP ﬂuor- escence was observed at 505-560 nm for emission and 488 nm forexcitation. Subcellular localization of OsCRW1 and OsERF82 To generate constructs of GFP-OsCRW1 orGFP-OsERF82 driven by the CaMV35S promoter ( pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 orpro35S::GFP-OsERF82 ), we ampli ﬁed the full-length CDS of OsCRW1 orOsERF82 from the cDNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced the CDS into the HindIII/EcoRI site of thepSAT6-GFP-C vector. The fragments of pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82 were isolated from the pSAT6-GFP-C vector by PI- PspI endonuclease and introduced into the PI-PspI site of the pRCS2 vector. The plasmids were transformed into rice protoplasts for tran-sient expression 70. Protoplasts were isolated from rice stems and labeled with the nucleus marker 4 ’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for co-localization. The GFP and DAPI ﬂuorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, LSM780) at505-560 nm and 400-470 nm for emission, respectively, and at 488 nmand 360 nm for excitation, respectively. Root cap size observation and amyloplast staining Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut and stained with 0.1%(w/v) basic fuchsin solution for 6 h. Root tips were resin-embedded,sectioned according to a previous method 71, and photographed under a microscope to reveal the root cap size. Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut, stained with 5% (v/v) Lugol ’ss o l u t i o nf o r1m i n u t e , washed with distilled water, and photographed under a microscope forthe observation of the amyloplasts in the root caps. Lugol ’ss t o c k solution was prepared by dissolving 5% (m/v) iodine in 10% (m/v) KIsolution. Fluorescence imaging of OsPIN2 localization, auxin response, cytosolic Ca2+and ROS Plants expressing proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP or the reporter gene for auxin response ( DR5rev::VENUS ) or for cytosolic Ca2+(NES-YC3.6 , dri- ven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter) were grown under different growth conditions or treatments for two to three days. Root tips were cut and immediately observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope. The GFP ﬂuorescence was observed as described above. The VENUS ﬂuorescence was observed at 520-550 nm for emission and 515 nm for excitation. For NES-YC3.6 detection, the measurement ofcpVENUS/ECFP ratio shifts was based on ﬂuorescence resonanceenergy transfer according to a previous method 50. The ECFP ﬂuores- cence was observed at 460-490 nm for emission and 415 nm for exci-tation. For detection of ROS, roots were incubated with 10 μM H 2DCFDA for 10 mins, washed with deionized water, and the ROS ﬂuorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning micro- scope at 505-560 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation,respectively 65. TUNEL assay The TUNEL assay was used to detect the programed cell death of rootcaps. Root tips were sampled and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 mins, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).Root tips were immersed in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for5 mins, washed with PBS, and incubated in the TUNEL detection solu-tion (Beyotime, China) at 37 °C for 1 h. The TUNEL ﬂuorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 515-565 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) The Y2H assay was used to detect the interaction between OsCRW1and OsEIL1 or OsEIL2.The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The full-length CDSofOsEIL1 orOsEIL2 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pGADT7 to generate the pGADT7-OsEIL1 and pGADT7-EIL2 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain (AD). The pGBKT7-OsCRW1 plasmid and pGADT7- OsEIL1 orpGADT7-OsEIL2 plasmid were transformed into the Y2H Gold yeast strain alone or in pairs. pGBKT7-53 together with pGADT7- Twere transformed as a positive control, and pGBKT7-lam together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium(-Trp, -Leu) to an optical density (OD) of 0.8. The serially dilutedyeast solution was inoculated on a double-de ﬁcient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu) and a quadruple-de ﬁcient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu, -His, -Ade, +X- α-gal) for growth. Bimolecular ﬂuorescence complementation The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was fused to the vector of pDONR221- P3P2 , and the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 andOsEIL2 were fused to the vector of pDONR221-P1P4 by gateway cloning, and then were trans- ferred into pBiFCt-2in1-NN vector alone or in pairs by LR clonase to fuse with the N- and C-terminal fragments of yellow ﬂuorescent protein (YFP). The ﬁnal plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tume- faciens strain GV3101. Bacterial cultures of the test combinations and controls were in ﬁltrated into tobacco (Latin name) leaves. Two days after in ﬁltration, the YFP signal was detected under confocal laser microscopy at 520-550 nm and 515 nm for emission and excitation, respectively. Western blot For immunological detection of OsEIL1-Flag, OsEIL2-Flag and OsActinin the roots of WT and crw1, total soluble proteins were extracted from 15-20 seminal roots with 1 ml plant protein extraction buffer. Proteinswere denatured by heating at 95 oC for 10 min in a metal-bath and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, proteins were transferredonto a polyvinylidene di ﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane and immunoblots were probed with the following antibodies in the TBST solution(100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%(v/v) Tween 20, pH=7.4) with 5% non-fat dry milk. A mouse anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and a mouse anti-Actin antibody (Beyotime, AA128,1:5000 dilution) were used as the primary antibodies and HPR-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Beyotime, A0216, 1:5000 dilution)was used as the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence wasArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Nature Communications |         (2025) 16:3712 14 performed using ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturer ’si n s t r u c t i o n s . Yeast one-hybrid The full-length CDS of OsEIL1 ,OsEIL2 orOsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGADT7 vector to express fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain. To detectthe binding of OsEIL1/2 with the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on thepromoter of OsERF82 , we introduced three copies of EBS into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in EBS was designed (EBS mut, CGAGA) and used as a negative control. To detect the binding of OsERF82 with the GCC-box (GCCGCC), G-box(CACGTG) and DRE/CRT (GCCGAC) on the promoter sequence ofOsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes, we introduced three copies of DRE/CRT, GCC box and G box sequence into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in each potential binding site was designed (GCC-box mut, ACCACC; G-box mut, AACTTG; DRE/ CRT mut, GTCGAA) and used as a negative control. pAbAi carrying dif- ferent binding sites were transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain toscreen the proper concentration of aureobasidin A (AbA) for inhibitingtranscriptional self-activation. pGADT7 carrying OsEIL1 orOsEIL2 or OsERF82 ,a n d pAbAi carrying different sequences were co-transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain. The yeast colonies were cultured in Leu-deﬁcient SD liquid medium to OD of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Leu-de ﬁcient SD medium (with or without AbA) for growth. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) The full-length CDS of OsEIL1 ,OsEIL2 orOsERF82 were introduced into the NdeI/XhoI site of the pET29a vector and transformed into Escher- ichia coli BL21 to express OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His or OsERF82-His fusion protein. OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His and OsERF82-His fusion proteins werepuriﬁed from E. coli by nickel af ﬁnity columns. Primers were designed for the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter sequence ofOsERF82 or designed for the ERF-binding sites including the GCC box, the G box and the DRE/CRT sequence on the promoter sequence ofOsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes to synthesize biotin-labeled probes, unlabeled probes, and unlabeled mutation probes. The pro- tein and probe were incubated with EMSA reaction solution (preparedaccording to the manufacturer ’s protocol, Beyotime, China) for 20 min at room temperature, separated on a 5% polyacrylamide native gel at4 °C, and transferred to a nylon membrane. After UV light cross-link-ing, the DNA on the membrane was detected using the Chemilumi-nescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module. Primers used are listed inSupplementary Table 2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)- qPCR assay The ChIP assay was performed using the BeyoChIP ™ChIP Assay Kit (Beyotime, P2080S, China) according to the manufacturer ’si n s t r u c - tions. Plants of pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/ crw1 were grown in water for two day, and 15-20 roots were collected as one biological replicate, with three biological replicates for eachexperiment. Root tissue was cross-linked in 1% (v/v) formaldehydeunder vacuum. Chromatin was extracted from the samples and frag-mented via ultrasound treatment to a size of 200-500 bp, and 2% of theyield was set aside as input template. The OsEIL1-DNA and OsEIL2-DNAcomplex were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (Invi-trogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and protein A/G beads (Beyotime,P2080S, China), or coimmunoprecipitated with IgG (Beyotime, A7028,China) with protein A/G beads. NaCl (0.2 M) was added to the solution of protein-DNA complex and heated at 65 °C for 4 hours to remove the cross-linking between protein and genomic DNA. According to themanufacturer ’s instructions, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloro- form agent for DNA puri ﬁcation (Solarbio, T0250, China). Primers (Supplementary Table 3) were designed near the three EBS sequenceson the OsERF82 promoter. Primers and puri ﬁed DNA were used for ChIP-qPCR. Transactivation activity of OsERF82 The full-length CDS of OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion protein containing the yeast GAL4 transcriptionbinding domain (BD). The pGBKT7-OsERF82 plasmid was transformed into the AH109 yeast strain. pGBKT7 plasmid was transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Drop-out (SD) liquid medium (-Trp) to OD = 0.8. The serially diluted yeastsolution was inoculated on Trp-de ﬁcient SD medium and double- deﬁcient SD medium (-Trp, -His, +X- α-gal) for growth. RNA sequencing RNA sequencing was performed on roots of crw1 and WT grown in water or in a soil-vermiculite mixture for two days. Each group con-tained three replicates with 15-20 plants per replicate. Total RNA wasextracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke). The cDNAlibraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencingplatform at Benagen Technology (Wuhan, China), and 150-bp paired-end reads were generated. For the analysis of gene expression, frag-ments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads and readcounts of each unigene were calculated and normalized based on thenumber of uniquely positioned reads overlapping the exon regions.Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identi ﬁed using R software (v.3.5.1) with the DESeq2 package ( http://bioconductor.org/packages/ release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html ). RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (Bio- Teke, Beijing, China). A HiScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit(Vazyme, Nanjing, China) was used to convert 1 μgo ft o t a lR N At o 20μL cDNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on an RT-PCR detection system (CFX96, Bio-Rad) by using SYBR Green Master Mix(Vazyme, Nanjing, China). OsActin and OsHistone were used as the internal reference genes. The expression levels were calculated using the equation 2 –Δ(ΔCt). Primers are shown in Supplementary Table 3.

This problem was recently addressed by Roach et  al. (2023 ) who studied three commonly employed methods.  These were two-arm matching, one-arm pointing and one- arm repositioning. Somewhat unexpectedly, each method  produced a significantly different outcome. This led to the  question, do we have more than one position sense? We have maintained a continuing interest in position  sense over the years and, more recently, become aware that  under conditions of weightlessness position sense is dis - turbed (Young et al. 1984 ; Kenyon and Young 1986 ; Weber  et al. 2020 ). It has led us to speculate about possible mecha - nisms responsible for the disturbance (Weber and Proske  2022 ; Proske and Weber 2023 ). In the light of the findings  by Roach et al. ( 2023 ) we have decided to re-measure posi - tion sense during changes in gravity with each of the three  methods and to look for differences in outcomes. Here we  were hoping to obtain new insight into the neural mecha - nisms underlying the generation of position sense. Arguably the most influential study of the effects of  changes in gravity on position sense is that by Lackner and  DiZio ( 1992 ). Position sense was measured, using a two- arm position matching task, during the rises and falls in Introduction The ability to accurately perceive the position of a body part  without looking at it, human position sense, is one of the  proprioceptive senses, “the senses within”. Proprioception  includes the senses of position, movement, force, heavi - ness, and balance (Proske and Gandevia 2012 ). Arguably,  the sense of position is the most important of these, since it  is believed to contribute to our self-awareness (Cole 1995 )  and it is an important contributor to the control of reach - ing movements (Desmurget et al. 1995 ; Sarlegna and Sains - burg, 2009 ).

This was tested, employing three meth - ods of measurement: two-arm matching, one-arm pointing and one-arm repositioning, carried out during parabolic flight.  In hypergravity (1.8G), position sense errors in a matching task increased significantly from the value during horizontal  flight (1G) of + 2.5° (± 3.8° SD), to + 3.5° (± 3.3°). For pointing, errors increased significantly from + 9.1° (± 4.4°) to  + 11.2° (± 4.4°). In microgravity (0G), matching errors fell significantly to + 0.35° (± 3.5°), while in pointing the fall was  not significant. For repositioning, there were no significant changes in errors in either hypergravity or microgravity. It is  proposed that the errors in matching and pointing are a consequence of the force of gravity acting at the elbow joint to  alter the position signal coming from muscle and joint receptors. For repositioning, memory of the test angle was stored  centrally, to be reproduced independently of any changes in gravity.

However, rather than study - ing position sense directly, the authors made observations on  the illusory changes in perceived limb position in response  to muscle vibration (Goodwin et al. 1972 ). The method has  the advantage of producing large changes in position sense  for which the influence of gravity can be readily studied.  Other reports on position sense in microgravity were those  of Bock ( 1994 ) and Bringoux et al. ( 2012 ). The explanation preferred by Lackner & DiZio for their  findings was that spindle output per unit stretch of arm  muscles was influenced by G-level. Spindle rates can be  altered by means of muscle length changes and by fusimo - tor activity. The authors proposed that gravity-dependent  vestibular stimulation led to changes in fusimotor activation  of spindles in forearm muscles and this altered the vibra - tion responses. Our own hypothesis for the gravity effects  was based on the findings of Bringoux et al. ( 2012 ). They  showed that errors were made in a reaching task, carried  out during parabolic flight, where participants overshot the  target in hypergravity and undershot it in microgravity. Add - ing gravity-like torque, by means of elastic straps stretched  across the arm before and during the movement recovered  participants’ performance in microgravity to resemble that  in normal gravity. The authors postulated that in micrograv - ity the increased joint torque generated by the elastic straps  enhanced arm position sense. We have considered the possibility that the normal posi - tion signal, especially near the flexion or extension limits of  a joint’s working range, was likely to include inputs from  both spindles and joint receptors (Proske 2023 ). In hyper - gravity, torque levels at the joint would be expected to  increase, to raise the joint receptor component of the posi - tion signal and therefore lead to increases in position sense  values above those for 1G levels. Similarly, a fall in joint  torque would lower the joint receptor component and there - fore reduce position sense values below 1G values. With this mechanism in mind, we compared position sense values  using the three methods and asked the question, were all  three similarly affected by the changes in gravity? In the present study we have chosen to measure position  sense directly, rather than as a vibration illusion. In view of  the findings of Roach et al. ( 2023 ), we have considered the  possibility of the existence of more than one position sense  (Weber and Proske 2022 ). It has led us to re-examine the  question of the effects of weightlessness on position sense,  more broadly. Participants were asked to measure position  sense with each of the three methods, during periods of  high and low gravity generated during a series of parabolic  flights. The aim was to try to confirm, during periods of high  and low gravity, the disturbance of position sense, measured  with each method. Methods Sample 12 adult participants (1female, 11male) 26–53 years old  (M = 37.9 years, ± 8.2 SD), took part in the present study.  Participation was voluntary. One of the participants had  previously taken part in similar parabolic flight campaigns.  None of the participants performed regular fitness exercises  with their arms or reported current or past arm injuries. All  participants underwent a medical assessment before taking  part in the flight campaign. In addition, their health status  was checked on the first day of the week of the flight cam - paign by an aviation physician. Participants were informed  in advance about the experimental tasks and procedures  and all provided written, informed consent. The experimen - tal protocol was approved by a French ethics committee  (“Comité de protection des personnes Sud-Méditerranée I”;  ID RCB number: 2023-A01115-40). Ethical aspects of the  project conformed with the Declaration of Helsinki. Apparatus Experimental setup The experimental setup consisted of an equipment rack  fixed to a base plate and two seats also on base plates, all  bolted firmly to the floor of the aircraft. In the equipment  rack, all necessary hardware components (personal com - puter, motor controllers, electronical components etc.) were  firmly locked in place. Two paddle setups, on each side of  the equipment rack, were installed, facing each other, so that  two participants could perform the experiment at the same  time (see Fig. 1). Each setup’s height could be adjusted   Fig. 1  Experimental Setup: Two participants sat facing one another in  the set-up. Both gave written consent to publication  1 3127  Page 2 of 12 Experimental Brain Research (2025) 243:127individually to suit the participant. In front of each partici - pant were two paddles, which could be moved freely in the  sagittal plane over a range of 90° from the horizontal (0°)  to the vertical position (90°). Mechanical stops prevented  movements beyond this range. Both paddles could be auto - matically moved to predefined angles by integrated motors.  For one of the two paddles and its motor, an electromagnetic  clutch was incorporated which, when released, allowed  the paddle to move freely, without any frictional or inertia  effects from the motor. Indicated angles were recorded by  potentiometers with an angular resolution of ± 0.3°. Selected  positions of both paddles could be locked in place by motor  brakes. At one end of each paddle was a soft elbow support  (with a Velcro strap to hold the elbow in position) and at  the other end there was a padded hand rest with a handle.  The elbow rest was positioned so that the elbow pivot point  and the paddle’s axis of rotation were aligned. The distance  between elbow rest and hand rest as well as the distance  between handle and paddle could be individually adjusted. To ensure body stabilization during microgravity, the  participants’ feet were strapped to the base plate of the  experimental setup. To stabilize participants during the  hypergravity phases, a seat support was placed behind the  participant which they could lean against or sit on (see  Fig. 1). All structures were padded with foam for protection.  At one side of the rack, the experimenter’s working area  was set up on the floor, equipped with a laptop for monitor - ing and controlling the experimental procedures. Experimental software The different gravitational phases during the parabolae  (1.8 g, 0 g, 1.8 g, 1 g) were detected using an acceleration  sensor. For the first hypergravity phase, measurements were  initiated after gravity values reached above 1.5 g, the micro - gravity phase after they fell below 0.6 g, and the second  hypergravity phase when the g-value was back above 1.3 g.  Finally, normal gravity was triggered when gravity values  had returned to below 1.15 g (Fig. 2). Each measurement  phase was initiated only when gravity changes persisted for  long enough. When conditions were suitable, the measure - ment proceeded, with the participant receiving their instruc - tions via headphones. The control of the paddles as well as  the evaluation of the accelerometer data was implemented  in Matlab/ Simulink. The control software was executed on  a real-time Linux platform at 1 kHz sampling rate. Timing  of the pre-recorded instructions and paddle positions in a  particular task were controlled by a JA V A program. The log - ging was implemented in C ++ enabling the automated iden - tification of each parabola phase in separate files.The experiments Participants completed three different experiments: (1) a  two-arm matching task, (2) a one-arm a pointing task, and  (3) a one-arm repositioning task. For all three experiments a  test angle of 60° was used, representing approximately the  middle of the forearm’s working range. Two-arm matching During this task, participants were blindfolded. The experi - ment started with both forearms in a flexed posture (i.e.  forearm at 90° to the horizontal). To begin with, forearm  muscles had to be conditioned, to account for spindle thixo - tropic properties. With both paddles locked in position,  the participant carried out isometric contractions of elbow  flexors of both arms, followed by isometric contractions of  elbow extensors. The contractions were approximately 20%  of maximum, 0.5s in duration. To do that, participants were  asked to pull both arms towards their body (“pull”), or to  push them away, (“push”). When participants had relaxed,  the experimental trials were started. One paddle was  unlocked and the passive forearm of the reference arm was  automatically moved in the direction of extension to the test  angle and held in that position. Then the clutch of the other  paddle opened and they were asked to bring the indicator  arm into a matching position. Participants were told to move  the indicator to a position where the two arms felt aligned. One-arm pointing In the pointing experiment participants wore an eye patch  over the eye closest to the reference arm which was also hid - den behind a cloth. It meant that during pointing neither the  reference arm nor its shoulder was visible to the participant.  Before the reference arm was moved to the test angle, it  was co-conditioned at 90°, as above. Participants carried out  contractions of flexors followed by contractions of exten - sors and, once they had relaxed, the arm was automatically  moved to a chosen test angle. The clutch of the other paddle  opened and participants were asked to move this pointer  paddle to a position that they felt corresponded to the posi - tion of the hidden reference arm. To do that, participants  grasped the pointer paddle by its handle and moved it into  position. One-arm repositioning Here, participants were also blindfolded. The participant co- conditioned both antagonists of one arm with isometric con - tractions. Once they had relaxed, the arm was automatically  moved to a chosen test angle. It was held at that angle for  1 3Page 3 of 12 127 Experimental Brain Research (2025) 243:127 Fig. 2  Examples of flight recordings.

In addition, the entire procedure for the  three experiments was rehearsed on the apparatus. The parabolic flights were organized and carried out by  NOVESPACE at Mérignac International Airport in Bor - deaux. The experimental crew and participants were briefed  by NOVESPACE before flight regarding general procedures  and safety regulations during the flight. Two pairs of partici - pants took part on each of the three subsequent flight days. On the morning of their flight day, participants completed  the pre-flight session in the aircraft while on ground. Dur - ing this session, participants were again reminded about the  experimental task, setup and procedure. Then, the control  experiment was carried out as described above. Immediately pre-flight, all participants (experimenter and  participants) received a standard dose of Scopolamine (0.7- 1.0 ml for first flyers, 0.5 ml for experienced flyers). Scopol - amine is the standard medication used to minimise the risk  of motion sickness during parabolic flights. Side effects can  be blurred vision, drowsiness, dilated pupils and dry mouth.  No participants in our study exhibited counter-reactions to  the drug and the subsequent experimental trials proceeded  uneventfully. However, one participant experienced motion  sickness during the repositioning experiment, despite hav - ing taken the drug and had to abandon the experiment. After  medication, participants boarded the flight, an Airbus A310. A complete flight took about 3.5 h and 31 parabolae were  flown during this period. The first parabola (#0) was used  for familiarization, i.e. participants simply lay down on  the floor of the aircraft during the parabola. Then, the first  pair of participants took up their positions at the setup; they  were secured with a harness, positioned their feet in the foot  straps and arms in the lever setup, put on the headphones  and, depending on the task, the eye patch/blindfold was put  in place. Meanwhile, the second pair of participants and the  experimenter were sitting on the floor at the side of the rack,  secured with belts to the floor of the aircraft. The typical time sequence for each parabola was ~ 20 s  hypergravity, ~ 22 s microgravity, again ~ 20 s hypergravity,  and finally, back to normal gravity. The transitions between  the various gravity phases were monitored by the acceler - ometer. When the required g-value had been reached, the  experiment was started and participants were instructed via  the headphones. After a break (~ 1 min 45 s), the next parab - ola was begun (see Fig. 2). After each participant had completed five parabolae there  was a break of 5 min, followed by a longer break of 8 min  after 15 parabolae. During the longer break, the next two  participants took up their position at the setup, the hand  rests were adjusted and the same protocol was carried out,  as before.2s while the participant remembered its position. Then the  arm was returned to its starting position before being condi - tioned a second time. The clutch of the paddle was released  and the participant was then asked to move their arm to the  remembered position. The pre-recorded instructions in all three conditions were  given via headphones. The contractions in the 90° position  were announced with “pull-push”, followed up by presenta - tion of the test angle with the announcement, “test angle”.  As soon as the clutch on the indicator side opened, the com - mand “match” was given. Now the participant could set the  desired matching angle; they had 6 s to do so and for the last  three seconds there was a countdown “3-2-1”. At the end  of the countdown, the angle adopted by the indicator arm  was recorded. This procedure was necessary given the time  limitations of the gravitational episodes. Experimental design There were two experimental sessions: a pre-flight session  and a flight session. During flight, participants performed  experimental trials during each gravity phase of a parabola:  (1) hypergravity (1.8 g), (2) microgravity (0 g), (3) hyper - gravity (1.8 g) and (4) horizontal flight (1 g). The pre-flight  data were used to provide a baseline for comparison with  results acquired during the flight. During the flight, each participant performed the experi - mental tasks over fifteen parabolae. An experimental block  during a parabola included each of the four gravity phases  (1.8 g, 0 g, 1.8 g, 1 g). This made for a total of 60 trials over  the 15 parabolae. Each of the three experiments was per - formed during five consecutive experimental blocks, while  their order was counterbalanced across participants. The  same procedure was adopted in the preflight session, except  that the pauses of about 1 min 45 s between each parab - ola in flight were shortened to 40 s. Moreover, participants  only completed two experimental blocks, i.e. two simulated  parabolae for each condition; 6 blocks x 4 phases = 24 trials.  The rest period between the three experiments was 100 s. Since it is known that there are differences in proprio - ception between the two arms (Goble et al. 2006 ), partici - pants were assigned to the two sides of the experimental  rack so that 6 participants had their dominant arm as the  reference, while the other 6 had their non-dominant arm as  the reference. Procedural arrangements All participants were informed about the background and  procedure of the study and about the parabolic flights, in an  online briefing one month before the experiment. 2–3 weeks  before the campaign, all participants were also invited to the  1 3Page 5 of 12 127 Experimental Brain Research (2025) 243:127Results Pre-flight As a first step, the data acquired on the ground (pre - flight session) were analysed. Since errors in the differ - ent experiments were normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk  test; W = 0.89), a rmANOV A could be performed, compar - ing the averaged position errors in the three experiments.  A significant overall main effect was found in rmANOV A  (F (2,22) = 10.99; p <.001; η2 = 0.50). Post-comparisons  indicated that errors were largest for pointing ( M = 5.95°;  SD = 5.64°), which were significantly larger than for match - ing ( M = 0.97°; SD = 4.0°; p <.0025, two-tailed testing, 2tt)  and repositioning ( M = -0.19°; SD = 3.96°; p <.007; 2tt; see  Table 1). In-flight, single participant Examples of position sense measurements for one partici - pant are shown in Fig. 3. During two-arm matching at 1G,  (NG), the mean error for the 5 episodes of horizontal flight  was 4.4°. That is, the participant matched the position of  their reference arm by placing the indicator 4.4° further  in the direction of extension. For the first period of hyper - gravity (HG 1) the mean error into extension increased to  4.8°. It then fell to 2.5° during the episode of microgravity  (MG), to reach a value of 7.7° during the second period of  hypergravity (HG 2). In other words, in relation to errors at  1G, there was an increase in hypergravity and a decrease in  microgravity. For one-arm pointing, the pattern of errors was similar.  The NG value for the mean of the 5 trials was 7.1° in the  direction of extension. This increased to 10.9° during HG  1 and to 10.6° during HG 2. In microgravity it fell to 5.7°.  A feature of the errors in pointing was that while increases  in errors in HG and falls in MG were smaller relative to the  NG value, compared with two-arm matching, all pointing  errors lay further in the direction of extension of the arm,  including the value for NG. Finally, for repositioning the  errors were all smaller than for matching and pointing. The  NG value was 0.5°. This fell to -1.8° during HG 1, that is,  the mean error was now 1.8° in the direction of flexion. The  error was again − 1.8° for HG 2 and − 0.6° for MG. In-flight, group data Group errors for the 12 participants are shown in Fig. 4. It  can be seen that errors in repositioning were much smaller  than in matching and pointing. For pointing and matching  the trend of an increase in errors during hypergravity and a  decrease during microgravity, relative to the normal gravity Data analysis For two-arm matching, the angles of the reference and indi - cator arms were recorded. The matching error was calcu - lated as the difference between the two angles (reference  angle - indicator angle), where positive values corresponded  to errors in the direction of arm extension and negative val - ues in the direction of flexion. The same was done for one- arm pointing; the angle of the hidden reference arm was  compared with the pointed value. The error for one-arm  repositioning was calculated as the difference between the  remembered angle and the repositioned angle. For the fol - lowing analyses, the recorded error measures were averaged  across all trials for one experiment (i.e. 2 blocks during pre - flight, 5 blocks for each gravitational phase during flight). The error measures were analysed with repeated measures  ANOV A (rmANOV A) comparing the three experiments  (matching vs. pointing vs. repositioning) in the preflight  session and a 3 (experiment: matching vs. pointing vs. repo - sitioning) x 3 (gravity: HG, MG, NG) rmANOV A for the  flight session. Sphericity was checked using Mauchly’s test.  Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were made if non-sphe - ricity was indicated by this test. Alpha levels of post-hoc  comparisons were Bonferroni-Holm corrected. In case of  non-normality of the error distributions, non-parametric  Friedman tests and subsequent Wilcoxon signed-rank tests  with Bonferroni-Holm alpha corrections were performed.  For all comparisons one-tailed tests (1tt) were performed  to verify directional hypotheses, otherwise two-tailed tests  (2tt) were chosen. Data for one participant during the repositioning experi - ment is missing, since they had to abandon the experiment.  As the result of a problem with data recording during the  pre-flight session, values for two participants from one of  the two experimental blocks in this session are missing.

Further analysis used only the in-flight values for normal  gravity (NG). The reason was that during flight there were  small fluctuations in g-values (see Fig. 2). For this reason,  and in order to take into account possible effects of Scopol - amine administration, comparisons were limited to within  flight. Next, the normal gravity episodes (NG) were compared  with the microgravity (MG) and hypergravity (HG) epi - sodes, (see Table 1; Fig. 4). For matching , two Wilcoxon tests were performed, indi - cating that error values were significantly lower (i.e. less  forearm extension) for MG ( M = 0.35°; SD = 3.50°) com - pared to NG ( M = 2.48°; SD = 3.80°; p =.0121, one-tailed  testing, 1tt). On the other hand, for HG, error values were  significantly higher ( M = 3.48°; SD = 3.29°; p =.0497, 1tt)  compared to the NG baseline. Wilcoxon comparisons for pointing  showed a trend for  error values to be lower in MG ( M = 7.28°; SD = 5.63°) com - pared to the NG values ( M = 9.09°; SD = 4.42°), although  the required level of significance was not reached ( p =.0583, value is clearly apparent. Values for matching were smaller  than for pointing. In-flight errors were not normally distributed (Shapiro- Wilk test; W  = 0.75; p =.00191), making it necessary to  process the data with non-parametric statistics. First, it was  tested whether there was an overall effect of experiments  on error values during the normal gravity episode. Fried - man indicated significant differences ( χ2(2) = 17.6; p <.001).  Again, errors in pointing (M = 9.09°; SD = 4.42°) were  significantly larger compared to repositioning ( M = 0.01°;  SD = 3.94°, p =.00669, 2tt) and matching ( M = 2.48°;  SD = 3.8°; p =.00665, 2tt, see Table 1) as indicated by Wil - coxon tests. Next, the errors in the two hypergravity episodes HG1  and HG2 were compared. For all three experiments, no sig - nificant difference was found in Wilcoxon tests ( Z = 0.39  − 0.71, 2tt). Therefore, errors in HG1 and HG2 were com - bined and averaged for the subsequent analysis and labelled  as hypergravity condition (HG). Additionally, the preflight  error values were compared to the normal gravity flight epi - sodes (NG), but no significant difference was found when  Fig. 3  Data from a single participant. a: Two-arm matching, b: One- arm pointing, c: One-arm repositioning.

The convention was used that positive values were assigned to errors in the  direction of elbow extension, negative values to errors in the direction  of flexion  1 3Page 7 of 12 127 Experimental Brain Research (2025) 243:127repositioning, the data suggested that position sense values  were unresponsive to changes in gravity. Given these differ - ences in outcomes, the current observations emphasize the  importance of declaring the method used whenever position  sense is measured, both at ground level and under condi - tions of weightlessness. Our observations suggest that of the  three methods used in the present study, with the method of  repositioning, it is not possible to reveal any disturbance of  position sense by gravity and that if gravity effects were to  be studied further, the preferred methods to use would have  to be matching or pointing. In Roach et al. ( 2023 ), before each measurement, elbow  muscles were conditioned in such a way that it brought out a  thixotropic pattern in the distribution of the position errors.  Since muscle spindles are the only known sensory recep - tors to exhibit thixotropy (Proske et al. 1993 ), such patterns  were interpreted as evidence for spindles being involved in  generation of the position signals. There was evidence of  spindle participation in position sense measured with two- arm matching and one-arm pointing, while for repositioning  the evidence was weak. Such an outcome reflected a similar  pattern to that seen with gravity effects in the present study.  It tempted us to say that when spindle participation in a  measurement could be demonstrated, this made it likely that  gravity effects could be revealed as well. It was as though  in a measurement of position sense the gravity effects were 1tt). Again, error values for HG were significantly higher  (M = 11.21°; SD = 4.38°) compared to NG ( p <.00222, 1tt). For the repositioning task , the two Wilcoxon tests com - paring NG ( M = 0.01°; SD = 3.94°) with HG ( M = -0.50°;  SD = 4.62°) and MG ( M = 0.23°; SD = 3.35°) did not reveal  any significant differences. In summary, for matching, during hypergravity position  errors increased significantly compared with 1G values,  while in microgravity they fell significantly. For pointing,  errors during hypergravity increased significantly, but the  fall in errors during microgravity failed to reach signifi - cance. By contrast, errors during repositioning showed no  significant changes during either increases or decreases in  gravity. In addition, the control values in normal gravity for  repositioning were significantly smaller than for pointing  (p <.003, 2tt). Discussion When we embarked on the present study, it was to ask  the question, did gravity influence position sense, no mat - ter what method of measurement was used (Weber and  Proske 2022 )? The present study has shown that for posi - tion sense measured by matching or pointing, changes in  gravity had significant effects on the measured values. For  Fig. 4  Matching, pointing and repositioning errors during the different  gravity episodes for 12 participants. Display of the mean errors (± SD,  shown by the error bars).

( 2012 ) that during parabolic flight reach - ing errors were made with changes in gravity. Participants  overshot the target in hypergravity and undershot it in  microgravity. Adding gravity-like torque, by means of elas - tic straps, stretched across the arm before and during the  movement, recovered participants’ performance in micro - gravity to resemble that in normal gravity. The authors  postulated that in microgravity the increased joint torque  generated by the elastic straps enhanced arm position sense.  One possible reason for this was an increase in skeletomotor  activity required to overcome the additional torque gener - ated by the straps and this would be accompanied by co- activated fusimotor activity that raised spindle discharges. We have suggested an alternate explanation. The normal  position signal, especially when generated near the flexion  or extension limits of a joint’s working range, is likely to  include inputs from both spindles and joint receptors (Pro - ske 2023 ; Proske and Weber 2023 ). Joint receptors have  an “activation angle” where they begin to generate a main - tained discharge, which in animal preparations is 15°-20°  short of the limit of movement at the joint. Therefore, when  a position is adopted, which is getting closer to the joint  limit, and the activation angle has been exceeded, there will  be signal mixing from two sources, stretched spindles and  activated joint receptors. The details have been spelt out in  Proske ( 2024a ). When hypergravity imposes extra torque on  the joint, the activation angle will be moved further towards  the middle of the movement range, increasing the opportu - nity for mixing, thereby raising the joint receptor component  of the position signal. In microgravity, if the arm becomes  weightless, there will be no standing torque on the joint and,  as a consequence, joint receptor input will fall, lowering  the position signal. Stretching elastic straps across the joint  would increase joint torque and raise the joint receptor com - ponent of the position signal. That, in turn, would recover  position sense values in microgravity to normal levels. To  further test these ideas we plan, in the future, to measure  position sense in microgravity with joint torque raised by  means of elastics stretched across the elbow joint. There is an interesting report by Motanova et al. ( 2022 )  describing construction of a “penguin axial loading suit”  for use in microgravity conditions. The purpose of the suit  was to create axial load, to help compensate for the lack of  proprioceptive afferent feedback in microgravity. The suit  incorporates a system of inbuilt elastic elements which are  distributed according to the demands of selected antagonist  muscle groups. The ideas underlying construction of such a  suit support our joint receptor hypothesis. In the present study, for pointing, the error values were  significantly larger than for matching (Fig. 4). Not only were  values larger during changes in gravity, but control errors at  1G were larger as well. A similar trend in the distribution linked in some way with the participation of spindles. That  conclusion strengthened our view that spindles played a key  role in the observed gravity-dependent changes in position  sense. In the present study, for matching and pointing there  were increases in errors in hypergravity and decreases in  microgravity. What might that mean? As mentioned, it is  believed that muscle spindles provide the position signal  during movements about a joint; an increase in spindle dis - charge signals a longer muscle, a more flexed or extended  joint (Matthews 1988 ). We suggest that there is a spindle  discharge - joint angle relation for the determination of  position sense, established during development (Held and  Bauer 1967 ). If, as a result of an increase in gravity, the  position signal increases, this would be expressed in both  arms, the reference arm sitting at 60° and the indicator  moved by the participant. Since the reference remains fixed  at the test angle, the signal coming from it would be higher  than expected from 1G values. The indicator would move  towards the position of the reference, until a point was  reached where the signals from the two arms matched. For  elbow flexors this would be a position where the indica - tor arm was more extended than the reference. If spindle  discharge in elbow flexors decreases in microgravity, this  would lead to a fall in position errors, producing values for  elbow extension below those for 1G levels. This argument does not consider the spindle signals in the  antagonist extensors. Presumably, in real life, it is the effect  of gravity on the balance of discharges in flexors and exten - sors which determines the direction of the errors. However,  in the present study, all of the errors for matching and point - ing were in the direction of elbow extension (Fig. 4), includ - ing the values in normal gravity, suggesting that the signal  coming from the flexors dominated the outcome. It could be argued that the smaller errors in micrograv - ity represented a more accurate measurement and not be a  disturbance at all. We propose that whenever the prevailing  spindle discharge rates are altered, up or down, away from  their normal 1G level, this should be seen as a disturbance.  These gravity-dependent alterations in the spindle rate: joint  angle relation lead the participant to perceive their arms in  positions which are unexpected and therefore makes them  unsure of the reliability of their movements when these are  made in the absence of vision. Here it should, perhaps, be remembered that there is  some evidence for gravity-based influences acting on posi - tion sense measured at ground level, under 1G conditions.  When participants were asked to judge elbow position with  respect to the vertical, they performed better than when  asked to focus on joint angles (Soechting 1982 ). Why should spindle discharges increase or decrease dur - ing gravity changes? In an arm reaching task it was shown  1 3Page 9 of 12 127 Experimental Brain Research (2025) 243:127The observations made in the present experiments sup - port the view that in repositioning there was no direct  involvement of spindles. Despite the significant changes in  gravity-dependent errors in matching and pointing, presum - ably mediated by changes in spindle afferent activity, for  repositioning, errors in both hypergravity and micrograv - ity remained non-significant. Furthermore, for reposition - ing, even the value during normal gravity was lower than  for pointing. We conclude that of the three methods, repo - sitioning was the most accurate and position sense values  remained unresponsive to changes in gravity, suggesting  that spindles played no role in this sense. Presumably, repo - sitioning values were generated entirely centrally. In the  future, we want to confirm this conclusion by repeating the  repositioning experiment, but carry out the memorizing and  repositioning stages in different gravity phases. We suggest that the instruction to the participant,  “Remember this angle”, leads them to focus their attention  on the position of the arm, which immediately provides  them with the precise angular information for that position.  A memory is triggered, expressed in terms of angles of joints  and lengths of muscles, but which, at the time of measure - ment, does not involve any ongoing spindle activity in arm  muscles. The memory is referred to a central storage site for  spatial information and kept there, ready for the instruction  to reproduce the remembered position. These ideas are, of  course, purely speculative and it is our intention to put them  to the test in future experiments. Looking more broadly, the present data support the view  that different methods of measuring position sense involve  fundamentally different underlying processes which will  impact the meaning of a particular measurement. This  is particularly relevant for the method of repositioning  which is the preferred method used in most proprioceptive  research and is widely employed in clinical settings. What  we are learning is that the three different methods of mea - suring position sense are all likely to have different underly - ing mechanisms and it could be argued that there are several  distinct position senses. There appear to be two sources of influence determining  human position sense. One is afferent signals of a periph - eral origin providing information about muscle lengths and  joint angles. The other is a central repository of recently  remembered information concerning position of the body  and its parts in egocentric and extrapersonal space, which  can be accessed to provide accurate spatial information  about limb position. The three methods of measurement  used in the present study seem to show a progressive transi - tion between these two influences; from one which relies  almost entirely on peripheral afferent information, two-arm  matching, to one that contains elements of both peripheral  and central influences, one-arm pointing, to one which is of pointing errors was observed by Roach et al. ( 2023 ). It  suggested that in normal gravity there was an offset, in the  direction of arm extension, in the measured values of point - ing errors. One possible explanation is that for pointing the  proprioceptive information coming from the hidden refer - ence arm must be converted to a visual frame of reference to  guide the pointing arm. Such a conversion comes with addi - tional errors when compared with a purely proprioceptive  measurement (Darling et al. 2024 ). We suggest that such an  offset was present in the parabolic measurements. A detailed  explanation for the size and direction of the offset remains  elusive. The question arises, do frame of reference considerations  also apply to two-arm matching? Here we have always  assumed that both arms were in the same postural frame  of reference (Velay et al. 1989 ). Certainly, the instructions  to the participants were always to align the position of one  arm with that of the other arm and no reference was made to  gravity. Evidence in support of two-arm matching operating  within a single frame of reference is the symmetrical distri - bution of thixotropic errors in both arms (Roach et al. 2023 ).  From another point of view, two-arm matching is consid - ered a low-level judgement, made within a single frame of  reference (Heroux et al., 2022 ). The findings for repositioning were rather different from  those for matching and pointing. The errors were all rather  small and there was no significant difference between posi - tion sense values during changes in gravity. Our original  working hypothesis for repositioning had been that when  a participant was asked to remember a chosen angle, the  spindle discharge generated in arm muscles at that angle  was stored in memory. Subsequently, when the participant  was asked to reposition the arm, the spindle discharge for  that angle was retrieved from memory and compared with  the ongoing level of activity, as the arm moved towards the  remembered angle, until the two matched. However, such an explanation turned out to be wrong!  The data of Roach et al. ( 2023 ) suggested that in reposition - ing ongoing spindle activity did not play a significant role.  It raised the possibility that in generating the position signal  the necessary information was likely derived from central  sources (Proske 2024b ). In support of that view, Roach et al.  (2023 ) did an additional experiment where they introduced  thixotropic disturbances after the memorizing stage and  before the reproduction stage. The data showed that this did  not alter repositioning errors. If spindles had been involved,  it should have led to increases in position errors. While we  cannot rule out participation of sensory receptors other than  spindles in the repositioning process, our current preferred  interpretation is that position information in repositioning  was largely derived from central sources (Proske 2024b ). 1 3127  Page 10 of 12 Experimental Brain Research (2025) 243:127if changes were made.

Gravity appears to exert an influence on position sense  only when there is evidence of a direct contribution from  spindles, as seen in matching and pointing. For reposition - ing it appears that the central influences predominate. What  is unexpected is the finding that the position values derived  centrally are more accurate than those which involve spin - dles. The concept of a central repository of position infor - mation operating independently of peripheral influences is  also novel. Presumably the stored information is acquired,  in part, through memories of past kinesthetic activities. To conclude, this study has raised a number of issues.  Does gravity exert its influence on position sense through  changes in torque levels at a joint, leading to an alteration  of the joint receptor component of the position signal? If  so, why is this not expressed in position sense measured by  repositioning? Assuming the existence of a body schema  as the central repository of spatial information, how is the  communication carried out between the body periphery and  central sites? Are spindles involved in this process? Given  that the three methods studied here measure essentially the  same thing, why are there such substantial differences in the  underlying mechanisms? If we are right and repositioning  operates substantially independently of peripheral sources  of positional information, what is the significance of that?  All of these issues will, hopefully, be addressed in future  experiments. Author contributions  Bernhard M.

A feature of the errors in pointing was that while increases in errors in HG and falls in MG were smaller relative to the NG value, compared with two-arm matching, all pointing errors lay further in the direction of extension of the arm, including the value for NG.
