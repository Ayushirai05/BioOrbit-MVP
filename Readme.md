# BioOrbit – NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025

## Overview
**BioOrbit** is an AI-powered knowledge engine for space biology.  
It is designed to summarize and visualize decades of NASA space biology experiments, enabling users to explore impacts and results of research relevant to Moon and Mars missions.

---

## Challenge
**NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**  
The challenge: NASA has conducted decades of biology experiments in space, generating massive publicly available data. However, this data is scattered across archives, making it difficult for researchers, students, and the general public to find and understand relevant information.  
The task: Build a dynamic dashboard using AI, knowledge graphs, and other tools to summarize NASA bioscience publications and make insights easily explorable.

---

## Our Idea
**BioOrbit** provides:  
- **Explore Mode:** Simplified summaries, visual dashboards, and key highlights for students and general users.  
- **Research Mode:** Detailed technical summaries, filters for experiment type, species, mission, and year, and full access to linked publications.  
- **Knowledge Graphs:** Relationships between experiments, species, environmental factors, and outcomes.  
- **Additional Features:** Timelines, “Earth vs Space” comparisons, and fun facts to engage learners.

## MVP Prototype
- Functional dashboard design in **Figma**.[View Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/9BAIhFb7NyQJ7kDuFUd0t6/BioOrbit?node-id=0-1&t=U59GFUkbV5CkHL5Z-1)
- Searchable experiment database (subset of 608 NASA publications).
- Explore and Research modes with sample summaries.
- Knowledge graph visualizations for relationships between entities.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend/UI:** Figma (prototype), planned React.js/HTML-CSS for functional dashboard.
- **Backend/AI:** Python, NLP.
- **Data:** NASA Space Life Sciences Library, CSV of selected publications.
- **Knowledge Graph:** Neo4j / visualization tools for entity relationships.

## How to Use
1. Open the **Figma link** for interactive UI prototype.[BioOrbit Prototype]((https://www.figma.com/proto/9BAIhFb7NyQJ7kDuFUd0t6/BioOrbit?node-id=0-1&t=U59GFUkbV5CkHL5Z-1))
2. Explore experiments in **Explore Mode** (easy, visual summaries).  
3. Switch to **Research Mode** for advanced filtering, detailed summaries, and knowledge graph exploration.  
4. Sample experiments include “Plant Growth under Microgravity,” with facts, visuals, and relationships.

---

## Status
- **Landing page:** Completed (rotating Earth animation, dual mode buttons).  
- **Explore & Research pages:** UI designed with search, filters, and demo summaries.  
- **Knowledge graph visualizations:** Ready for AI-driven demo.  
- **Next Steps:** Integrate backend AI summarization, full dataset, and finalize MVP for submission.
