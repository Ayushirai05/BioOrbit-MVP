A. van Loon 2,3, Luigi Gennaro Izzo 1, Maurizio Iovane 1 &\\nGiovanna Aronne 1\\nUnderstanding the response of plants to varied gravitational conditions is vital for developing\\neffective food production in space bioregenerative life support systems. This study examines the\\nimpact of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphological responses of Wolffia globosa\\n(commonly known as “water lentils” or “duckweed”), assessing its potential as a space crop. Although\\nan experiment testing the effect of simulated microgravity on Wolffia globosa has been previously\\nconducted, for the first time, we investigated the effect of multiple gravity levels on the growth\\nand morphological traits of Wolffia globosa plants. The plant responses to simulated microgravity,\\nsimulated partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity environments were evaluated using random\\npositioning machines and the large‑diameter centrifuge. As hypothesized, we observed a slight\\nreaction to different gravitational levels in the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa.\\nThe relative growth rates (RGR) of plants subjected to simulated microgravity and partial gravity\\nwere reduced when compared to those in other gravity levels. The morphological analysis revealed\\ndifferences in plant dimensions and frond length‑to‑width ratios under diverse gravity conditions.\\nOur findings showed that Wolffia globosa is responsive to gravitational changes, with its growth and\\nmorphological adaptations being slightly influenced by varying gravitational environments. As for\\nother crop species, growth was reduced by the microgravity conditions; however, RGR remained\\nsubstantial at 0.33 a day.

This was tested, employing three meth-\\nods of measurement: two-arm matching, one-arm pointing and one-arm repositioning, carried out during parabolic flight.\\nIn hypergravity (1.8G), position sense errors in a matching task increased significantly from the value during horizontal\\nflight (1G) of + 2.5\\u00b0 (\\u00b1 3.8\\u00b0 SD), to + 3.5\\u00b0 (\\u00b1 3.3\\u00b0). For pointing, errors increased significantly from + 9.1\\u00b0 (\\u00b1 4.4\\u00b0) to\\n+ 11.2\\u00b0 (\\u00b1 4.4\\u00b0). In microgravity (0G), matching errors fell significantly to + 0.35\\u00b0 (\\u00b1 3.5\\u00b0), while in pointing the fall was\\nnot significant. For repositioning, there were no significant changes in errors in either hypergravity or microgravity. It is\\nproposed that the errors in matching and pointing are a consequence of the force of gravity acting at the elbow joint to\\nalter the position signal coming from muscle and joint receptors. For repositioning, memory of the test angle was stored\\ncentrally, to be reproduced independently of any changes in gravity.\\nKeywords Position sense \\u00b7 Proprioception \\u00b7 Microgravity \\u00b7 Hypergravity \\u00b7 Parabolic flight\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"conclusion\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \", this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a\\nspace crop and its adaptability t\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_file\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"3.41467_2023_Article_44357.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Mason5,6,7,8, Kasthuri Venkateswaran3\\u2020   and Afshin Beheshti9,10\\u2020    Abstract  Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has a detrimental impact on human health on Earth and it is equally  concerning in other environments such as space habitat due to microgravity, radiation and confinement, especially  for long\\u2011 distance space travel. The International Space Station (ISS) is ideal for investigating microbial diversity and  virulence associated with spaceflight. The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial  Tracking\\u20131 (MT \\u20111) project and resulting metagenome \\u2011assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight  different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR  genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs  retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes). Results: We have analyzed the data using a deep learning model, allowing us to go beyond traditional cut \\u2011offs  based only on high DNA sequence similarity and extending the catalog of AMR genes. Our results in PMA treated  samples revealed AMR dominance in the last flight for Kalamiella piersonii, a bacteria related to urinary tract infection  in humans. The analysis of 226 pure strains isolated from the MT \\u20111 project revealed hundreds of antibiotic resistance  genes from many isolates, including two top \\u2011ranking species that corresponded to strains of Enterobacter bugandensis  and Bacillus cereus. Computational predictions were experimentally validated by antibiotic resistance profiles in these  two species, showing a high degree of concordance. Specifically, disc assay data confirmed the high resistance of  these two pathogens to various beta\\u2011lactam antibiotics. Conclusion: Overall, our computational predictions and validation analyses demonstrate the advantages of machine  learning to uncover concealed AMR determinants in metagenomics datasets, expanding the understanding of the ISS  environmental microbiomes and their pathogenic potential in humans.

Accordingly, with NASA setting the course  to return to the Moon with the Artemis mission and  eventually venture out to Mars, maintaining the health  of astronauts during long-term spaceflight is of para - mount importance [1 ]. One area of particular concern  is the reported increase in virulence and antibiotic  resistance of microorganisms in space experiments [4 ,  30, 36, 49, 51, 56, 61]. Combined with a depressed or  altered immune response in astronauts [25, 46], there  is an increased risk of opportunistic microbial infec - tion. Spaceflight promotes biofilm formation [32], and  bacteria cultured from astronauts during flight were  more resistant than isolates obtained from the same  individual either pre- or post-flight [50]. Mutations also  occurred more frequently in long-term spaceflights  [24]. An alternative non-mutually exclusive hypothesis  to increased virulence or microbial resistance to anti - biotics is that spaceflight conditions might alter the  stability of pharmaceuticals [23]. In any case, bacterial  infections might be more challenging to treat in space. The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed-built  environment with its own environmental microbiome  shaped by microgravity, radiation, and limited human  presence [53]. We and others have shown that microbi - omes are dynamic, diverse and sometimes intertwined  at the ISS. Be et\\u00a0al. [8] analyzed antibiotic resistance and  virulence genes from dust and vacuum filter samples of  ISS (treated with propidium monoazide, or PMA), dem - onstrating that human skin-associated microbes impact  the ISS microbiome. Indeed, the skin and intestinal  microbiomes of astronauts that spent 6 to 12 months in  the ISS have been shown to be altered [55]. In addition,  the salivary microbiome of astronauts changed as a result  of spaceflight, potentially activating microbes that pro - mote viral replication [52] and altering the abundance of  some antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes [35]. The ISS  itself also presents specific core microbiome signatures  on its surfaces that we characterized recently using shot - gun metagenome and amplicon sequencing [14, 43, 51],  analogous to microbiome signatures found in specific  geographies on Earth [18]. Further analyses across several missions have revealed  that the microbiome of the crew\\u2019s skin resembled those of  the surfaces inside the ISS collected by the crewmember  on the same flight [5]. To better understand the compo - sition of these bacterial populations we and others have  characterized shotgun whole-genome sequencing (WGS)  of several ISS microorganisms [10, 11, 45]. Although  most of them have been found to be non-pathogenic to  humans, there are exceptions such as antibiotic-resist - ant Enterobacter bugandensis strains that could have an  increased chance of pathogenicity [44].Computational analyses of microbiome data collected  in Earth have shown that AMR can be predicted from  genomic sequence of pure cultures alone [29, 47], but a  consensus approach on the best way to detect AMRs  in metagenomic datasets has yet to be established [41].  Generally, predictions are restricted to high identity  (high sequence similarity to databases) cut-offs, requir - ing a \\u2018best-hit\\u2019 on an appropriate AMR database with a  sequence identity greater than 80% by many programs  such as ResFinder [60]. Although the \\u2018best-hit\\u2019 approach  has a low false-positive rate, the false-negative rate can  be very high, and a large number of actual Antibiotic  Resistance Genes (ARGs) are predicted as non-ARGs,  thus concealing the identification of potentially func - tional ARGs [3]. Another method of identification is to  link the immune repertoire of the astronaut to the pep - tides of the microbes on the ISS, but this requires com - plex coordination with crew sampling and is rare [19].  However, it has been shown recently that deep learn - ing, a class of machine learning algorithms, can expand  the catalog of AMR genes and increase the accuracy  of the predictions based on metagenomic data [3, 13,  27]. We then hypothesized that the characterization of  AMR from sequencing data at the ISS could be investi - gated from an artificial intelligence perspective using a  robust deep learning framework. For that, we analyzed  whole-genome sequences of 226 pure strains (cultivable  microbes), metagenome sequences of 21 environmental  samples, and 24 MAGs retrieved from PMA treated sam - ples (Fig.\\u00a0 1) using the supervised deep learning approach  proposed by Arango-Argoty et\\u00a0al. [3], which has shown  high sensitivity for detection of AMR genes in an inde - pendent benchmark [57]. Results Predictions based on\\u00a0short\\u00a0metagenomics sequences  and\\u00a0ORFs partly overlap with\\u00a0previous analyses and\\u00a0reveal  new AMR determinants at\\u00a0the\\u00a0ISS surface microbiome The first shotgun metagenome sequencing of intact  microbial cells (Propidium monoazide-PMA treated)  without whole-genome amplification was performed by  Singh et\\u00a0al. [43]. There, samples were taken in 8 locations  across three flights (F1, F2, F3) during a period of 12  months. A detailed description of sampling procedures  and locations, species diversity and functional charac - terization can be found in Singh et\\u00a0al. [43]. To deploy a  deep learning approach for predicting antibiotic resist - ance genes from metagenomic data, we used DeepARG,  a computational resource proven to be more accurate  than traditional approaches [3]. We first run DeepARG- SS (DeepARG for short reads) using the recommended  prediction probability cut-off of 0.8 to obtain read  counts of AMR genes (Fig.\\u00a0 2a). As in the seminal paper  Page 3 of 12  Madrigal\\u00a0et\\u00a0al. Microbiome          (2022) 10:134    [43], quantification of antibiotics associated with AMR  revealed \\u2018beta lactams\\u2019 ranking first and \\u2018peptide\\u2019 sec - ond, and generally more AMR reads counts observed in  Flight 3 (F3) than in previous two flights (Fig.\\u00a0 2a). How - ever, reads counts in certain antibiotics such as pleuro - mutilin, mupirocin and rifamycin were found largely in  Flight 2 (Fig.\\u00a0 2a). Our read counts correlate (r = 0.86,  p = 6.879e\\u22127; Pearson\\u2019s product-moment correlation)  with read counts obtained for antimicrobial resistance by  Singh et\\u00a0al. [43] (Fig.\\u00a0 2b). Taken together, these suggest a  partial overlap with results obtained in Singh et\\u00a0 al. [43]  analyzed using the traditional approach. While more AMR reads counts were found in Flight  3, we also observed variability between the different  locations and flights, and an increasing number of read  counts associated with time. For instance, location 4  (L4, surface of the dining table) increased the number  of AMR reads counts with successive flights (Fig.\\u00a0 2b, c).  While resistance to \\u2018beta lactams\\u2019 was evenly distributed  across flights and locations, resistance to \\u2018polymyxin\\u2019 and  especially \\u2018peptide\\u2019 represents a more significant pro - portion of AMR counts in locations of Flight 3 (Fig.\\u00a0 2c).  In addition, we also observed the widespread presence  of reads related to Macrolides, Lincosamides, Strepto - gamines (MLS), and tetracycline resistance. To investigate the possible association between AMR  patterns and specific microbes, we assembled the short  reads into Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs;  see Methods), identified their Open Reading Frames (ORFs), and repeated the prediction of ARGs using  DeepARG-LS [3]. Figure\\u00a0 3a shows the distribution of  DeepARG classification probabilities and best-hit iden - tity of ARGs in MAGs from the ISS. As we can retrieve  highly probable ARGs (probability > 0.8) presenting low  sequence identity (for many ARGs, identity is < 40%), this  method is likely more advantageous than using the \\u2018best- hit\\u2019 approach only. Compared to DeepARG-SS results  obtained previously, the analysis of MAGs did not reveal  significant differences in the number of ARGs predicted  in the ORFs for the different flights (Fig.\\u00a0 3b). However,  interestingly the results show a smaller number bacterial  species having ARGs in Flight #1 (F1) when compared  to Flights #2 and #3 (Fig.\\u00a0 3b, c) (data is shown for MAGs  with at least 1 predicted ARG; the total number of MAGs  analyzed is 24). Specifically, the number of locations is  smaller in Flight 1 (n =\\u00a03) than in F2 (n = 6) and F3 (n  = 7) (Fig.\\u00a0 3b). Many ARGs were identified in Kalamiella  piersonii MAGs in multiple locations during F3, show - ing AMR patterns related to (glyco)peptide, fluoroqui - nolone and MLS (Fig.\\u00a0 3c). Of note, the K. piersonii strain  closely related to one found at the ISS has been associ - ated to human urinary tract infection [40]. The poten - tially very pathogenic microbe E. bugandensis was found  in location 2 (forward side panel wall of the Waste and  Hygiene Compartment) in Flight 1, presenting more than  40 ARGs. In addition, in the original study, Pantoea spe - cies were found to be the dominant genus in samples in  5 out of 7 locations sampled from Flight 3, especially at  Fig. 1 Overview of sample collection and data analysis for the characterization of antibiotic resistance at the ISS using deep learning. The data are  processed in a step \\u2011wise fashion including data QC, mapping, quantification, and matching to time of collection and mission.

In our re-analysis, we observed  Pantoea brenneri and Pantoea dispersa having ARGs  related to beta-lactams and peptide [43], as well as to tri - closan and polymyxin resistance.Overall, our results partially agree with earlier find - ings while providing new insights into previously  unobserved antibiotic resistance classes (of the 30  antibiotic resistance categories included in the model).

Microbiome          (2022) 10:134  Specifically, the re-analysis of short sequences and  MAGs from the ISS reveals dominance of K. piersonii   antibiotic resistance in different locations of Flight 3  (Fig.\\u00a03 c). Distribution of\\u00a0antibiotic resistance genes in\\u00a0scaffolds  of\\u00a0Microbial Tracking\\u20111 strains isolated from\\u00a0the\\u00a0ISS We then applied DeepARG-LS to 226 Microbial Track - ing-1 (MT-1) isolates (Mason and Venkateswaran labs,  published and unpublished WGS of MT-1 pure strains  isolated from ISS environment). We found a range of 2 to  92 ARGs in 184 out of 226 isolates (Fig.\\u00a0 4a; Table\\u00a0 S1). This  machine learning approach allowed us to go beyond the  traditional cut-off based only on high sequence DNA simi - larity (Figure\\u00a0 S1). These results suggest a widespread pres - ence of potential ARGs in the isolates, with \\u2018multi-drug\\u2019  class being first, followed by glycopeptides, beta-lactams,  bacitracin, and tetracyclines. The \\u2018multi-drug\\u2019 antibiotic  class was defined by aggregating several antibiotic names  from the CARD and ARDB databases (efflux, multi-drug  and na_antimicrobials). We then used BLAST to match  isolates showing AMR sequences predicted by Deep - ARG to microbial species (Fig.\\u00a0 4a) and identified Bacillus  cereus and E. bugandensis, which were previously profiled  organisms on the ISS [44, 54] as the top 2 ranking species  with a high number of ARGs. We have previously shown  that five E. bugandensis isolates were almost equivalent to  nosocomial earth isolates showing resistance to multi-drug  antibiotic compounds, fluoroquinolones, and fosfomycin  [44]. In addition, E. bugandensis strains were shown to  be resistant to 9 antibiotics [51]. Our results reinforce the  potential pathogenicity of this microbe. Nonetheless, anti - microbial resistance was not examined for B. cereus strains  in Venkateswaran et\\u00a0al. [54]. B. cereus is a food poisoning  microorganism that might be a concern for crew mem - bers\\u2019 health. In addition, we found novel ARGs associated  with other species such as K. pneumoniae, Pantoea, Pae- nibacillus polymyxa, Bacillus velezensis, Enterococcus fae - calis , Sphingomonas, and, with a lower number of ARGs,  several species of Staphylococcus. E. faecalis virulence was  previously shown to be affected by microgravity [28]. We  then used the tool Prokka [42] to fully annotate the bacte - rial isolates, finding as expected that the number of coding  sequences, but not the number of ARGs, increased in pro - portion to genome sizes (Figure\\u00a0 S2a). Then, we ran the pan- genome analysis tool Roary [38] to compare isolates of E. bugandensis (10) and B. cereus (10) finding that the core set  of genes was highly conserved among strains of the same  species (Figure\\u00a0S2b). To experimentally validate machine learning predic - tions on previously unobserved AMR patterns above,  we performed Antibacterial Susceptibility Tests (AST)  for the species found to be potentially most pathogenic,  in our case E. bugandensis and B. cereus as they have a  higher number of ARGs (Table\\u00a0 S1; Fig.\\u00a0 4a). For that, we  use disc diffusion on strains isolated at the ISS for the fol - lowing antimicrobials: Cefazolin (beta\\u2212 lactam), Cefoxitin  (beta\\u2212lactam), Ciprofloxacin (quinolone), Erythromycin  (MLS), Gentamycin (aminoglycoside), Oxacillin (beta\\u2212 lac- tam), Penicillin (beta\\u2212 lactam), Rifampin (rifamycin), and  Tobramycin (aminoglycoside) (Fig.\\u00a0 4b). The prediction pat - terns closely matched the AST results (Fig.\\u00a0 4b), although  DeepARG failed to detect Rifampin resistance, especially  for E. bugandensis. Although different antibiotics have different inhibitory  zone cut-offs for a strain to be considered as resistant  (Table\\u00a0 S2), remarkably we found an inverse correlation  between the zone of inhibition and ARG count for B.  cereus (r = \\u2212 0.637, Pearson\\u2019s product-moment correla - tion, p = 2.2e\\u22127) and E. bugandensis (r = \\u2212 0.517; p =  0.0002765) (Fig.\\u00a0 4c), demonstrating the applicability and  high accuracy of computational prediction of AMR for  microbiome data obtained in space. Discussion Many ARGs that present high probability but low  sequence identity to known sequences will be missed  using traditional \\u2018best-hit\\u2019 approaches that require a  high degree of sequence identity. To solve this, compu - tational methods have been developed to identify AMR  in genomes and metagenomes [3, 9, 16, 33, 41]. Despite  these developments, a consensus approach to detect  AMR in metagenomics datasets is yet to be defined [41].  The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes  associated with cultivated strains and metagenomes  generated from the ISS environmental surfaces using an  accurate deep learning approach (Fig.\\u00a01). Firstly, we re-analyzed shotgun metagenome sequences  of 21 environmental samples that were treated with  PMA (viable microbes), and their associated 24 MAGs  retrieved from the PMA-treated samples. The re-analysis  showed increased read counts associated with AMR and  Fig. 4 Heatmap and clustering of ARG counts detected in MT \\u20111 pure strains isolated from the ISS and AST validations. a Heatmap with ARG count.

Microbiome          (2022) 10:134  in more locations for flight 3 when considering MAGs  (Fig.\\u00a0 2). This could be explained due to the ISS crew being  replaced during Flight 3. The abundance of Enterobac - teriaceae in Flight 3 was discussed in Singh et\\u00a0 al. [43].  We have not observed any differences between early vs.  late ISS microbiome cultures. For example, Enterobacter  bugandansis  strains were isolated from F2 and F3 sample  sets, but the genome comparison and phenotype analy - ses revealed limited change, with a maximum of 15 SNPs  among ISS isolates [44]. In addition, K. piersonii spread  across four different locations (L1, L5, L7, L8) at Flight  3, presenting resistance to specific antibiotics (glyco/ peptide, fluoroquinolone and MLS) (Fig.\\u00a0 3c). We have  previously isolated strains from Locations 1, 2, 5, 6, and  7, defining a novel bacterial genus from the ISS samples  [45]. While K. piersonii do have virulence genes in the  genome, a dichotomy was found as disc diffusion tests  revealed multi-drug resistance, while the PathogenFinder  algorithm predicted K. piersonii strains as non-human  pathogens. All seven K. piersonii isolates were resistant to  cefoxitin (beta_lactam class in DeepARG), erythromycin  (MLS), oxacillin (beta_lactam), penicillin (beta_lactam),  and rifampin. At the same time, all strains were suscepti - ble to cefazolin, ciprofloxacin (quinolone), and tobramy - cin (aminoglycoside) [45]. The DeepARG database does  not include some of these antibiotics, but we found AMR  sequences related to resistance to (glyco)peptide, fluoro - quinolone, and MLS, validating some previous results.  Therefore, PathogenFinder [17] results in Singh et\\u00a0al. [45]  suggesting K. piersonii as a non-human pathogen should  be treated with caution. Furthermore, the strain YU22  (closest match is IIIF1SW-P2T detected as ISS) isolated  in urine microbiome of a kidney stone patient has shown  to be an uropathogenic bacteria, showing many virulence  factors that are needed for host cell invasion and coloni - zation [40]. Secondly, the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of 226  pure strains (cultivable microbes) were analyzed to iden - tify AMR genes (Fig.\\u00a0 4a). We found the human pathogens  E. bugandensis and B. cereus presenting many potential  ARGs in the MT-1 scaffolds. Up to five strains isolated  from the ISS have been closely related to the type strain  EB-247T and two clinical isolates (153_ECLO and MBRL  1077) and share similar AMR patterns [44]. One hundred  twelve genes were found to be involved in virulence, dis - ease, and defence in the ISS strains [44]. Our re-analysis  confirms the multi-drug resistance (MDR) to antibiotics  for the ISS isolates, which is the highest among all the iso - lates. Our previous research uncovered the presence of  genes associated with MDR efflux pump [44], belonging  to RND (resistance, nodulation and cell division) protein  family, which are reported to be the major contributors  of resistance to antibiotic and other toxic compounds to the bacteria [20]. MDR has been reported to play role in  the physiological function and confer resistance to sub - stances like host defense molecule and bile, which can  lead to pathogenicity in humans [48]. Unlike in Singh  et\\u00a0al. [43], we found fluoroquinolone resistance low, and  null for fosfomycin. Conversely, B. cereus is a gram-pos - itive bacterium commonly found in food. After infec - tion, most emetic patients recover within 24 hours, but in  some cases, the toxin can be fatal via a fulminant hepatic  failure [22, 34]. Overall, multi-drug resistance was found  widespread in many microbes. Third, phenotypic antibiotic resistance testing data  obtained from traditional antibiotic tests generated for  biosafety level 2 strains were compared with the com - putational approaches that predicted the presence of  the AMR genes, showing an excellent agreement for the  antibiotics tested (Fig.\\u00a0 4b, c). A disadvantage of the deep  learning model developed by Arango-Argoty et\\u00a0al. [3] is  that the prediction can disentangle the family of antibiot - ics but not specific compounds. Many studies have shown the association between  several microorganisms (bacterial, as well as phage and  non-phase viral sequences) and several cancer features.  Although it is unclear whether this corresponds to corre - lation or causation, the microbiome can undoubtedly be  used as a cancer biomarker. For instance, certain strains  of Fusobacterium\\u00a0 sp. can be utilized as an independent  diagnostic assay for colon cancer [62]. Therefore, a better  understanding of the microbial communities and their  degree of pathogenicity in surface-human microbiomes  in space could also be useful for human health monitori - zation with detection and prognostic values in long term  space travel. Rather than the gather-and-return sampling  model currently used for the ISS, new developments in  sequencing technologies in combination with Artificial  Intelligence will allow for efficient analysis onboard the  ISS and in long-duration space missions. We are currently collecting more data for Micro - bial Tracking-2 (MT-2) and MT-3 missions. We plan to  extend the AMR catalog, characterize microbial diversity,  and monitor the evolution of AMR in longer time peri - ods to discover new factors involved in pathogenicity of  microorganisms exposed to space conditions. Methods Metagenome\\u2011Assembled Genomes (MAGs) methodology The paired-end 100-bp metagenomic reads from NCBI  Short Read Archive (SRA) under the bio-project number  PRJNA438545 were processed with Trimmomatic [12]  to trim adapter sequences and low-quality ends, with a  minimum Phred score of 20 across the entire length of  the read used as a quality cut-off. Reads shorter than 80  bp were removed after trimming. Remaining high-quality  Page 9 of 12  Madrigal\\u00a0et\\u00a0al. Microbiome          (2022) 10:134    reads were subsequently assembled using metaSPAdes  [37]. Contigs were binned using Metabat2 v2.11.3 [31].  Recovered genomes were evaluated with CheckM [39],  and a recovered genome was considered good with at  least 90% completeness and at most 10% contamina - tion. Each genome was subsequently annotated with the  help of Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology  (RAST), and near identifications were predicted [6]. Sample collection for\\u00a0Microbial Tracking 1 mission During the microbial tracking investigation to character - ize airborne and surface-associated microbial population  aboard the International Space Station, samples were col - lected from ISS locations, and ground samples were col - lected from the Crew resupply vehicle. A sterile polyester  wipe premoistened with Phosphate buffered saline (PBS)  was used to collect the samples from various areas across  these ISS locations, and the details and description of  the sample collection and cultivation have already been  reported in Checinska Sielaff et\\u00a0al. [14] and Singh et\\u00a0al.  [43]. Pure isolates were selected and sub-cultured, and  the sub-cultures were sequenced. Isolates from\\u00a0Microbial Tracking 1 mission To create the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of these  strains, shotgun libraries were prepared using the Illu - mina Nextera Flex protocol [44], using NovaSeq 6000  S4 flow cell 2150 paired-end (PE) sequencing. Verifica - tion of the quality of the raw sequencing data was carried  out using FastQC v0.11.7 [2]. Quality control for adapter  trimming and quality filtering were performed using fastp  v0.20.0 [15], and then SPAdes v3.11.1 [7] was used to  assemble all the cleaned sequences. Fastp quality control  was based on the following three parameters: (i) correc - tion of mismatches in overlapped regions of paired-end  reads, (ii) trimming of autodetected adapter sequences,  and (iii) quality trimming at the 59 and 39 ends. To deter - mine the quality of the assembled sequences, the num - ber of contigs, the N50 value, and the total length were  calculated using QUAST v5.0.2 [26]. Default parameters  were used for all software. The average nucleotide iden - tity (ANI) [59] was calculated using OrthoANIu by com - paring each of the scaffolds to the WGS of the respective  type strains. Identification of\\u00a0ORFs in\\u00a0microbial DNA sequences Glimmer (Gene Locator and Interpolated Markov Mod - elER) v3.02 was used with default parameters to identify  the coding regions and distinguish them from non- coding DNA in MAGs and MT-1 scaffolds that could  be used as an input in DeepARG-LS. Minimum gene  length was indicated as 50 bp (\\u2018glimmer3 -g50\\u2019). Glim - mer reads DNA sequences in a FASTA file format and predicts genes in them using an Interpolated Context  Model [21]. Prediction of\\u00a0antibiotic resistance genes in\\u00a0short\\u00a0reads  and\\u00a0full\\u2011gene length sequences DeepARG version 2 [3 ], a deep learning-based approach  for predicting ARGs and annotation, was run with  the \\u2018--reads\\u2019 option (DeepARG-SS) for NGS reads and  the \\u2018--genes\\u2019 option (DeepRG-LS) for longer gene-like  sequences obtained with Glimmer. The DeepARG model  consists of four dense hidden layers of 2000, 1000, 500,  and 100 units that propagate a bit score distribution. The  output layer of the deep neural network consists of 30  units that correspond to the antibiotic resistance catego - ries (102 antibiotics consolidated into 30 antibiotic cat - egories). The model was trained with a curated database  of 14,933 genes from three databases (CARD, ARDB, and  UNIPROT) [ 3]. Default options were used: 50% minimum  percentage of identity to consider, significance of the pre - diction probability cut-off of 0.8 as recommended [3 ],  and E-value of alignments (default 1e\\u2212 10). The software  was downloaded from https:// bitbu cket. org/ gusph dproj/   deepa rg-  ss. Microbial nucleotide BLAST Nucleotide-Nucleotide BLAST 2.10.1+ (https:// blast.  ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ Blast. cgi) was used to identify micro - bial species associated to MT-1 scaffolds. Sequences  producing significant alignments were ranked and the  species associated to maximum Score (bits) and mini - mum E value was deemed as the closest match. Gene annotations and\\u00a0pan\\u2011genome analysis of\\u00a0MT\\u20111  scaffolds A Docker image with the software tool Prokka v1.14.5  [42] was pulled and used with default parameters to  annotate bacterial isolates. The master annotations in  GFF3 format for the 226 isolates have been deposited at  the Zenodo platform [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6518836].  Using the annotated assemblies in GFF3 format for E.  bugandensis and B. cereus strains, Roary v3.13.0 was run  with default parameters to compare isolates based on  genes and the number of isolates they are present in. Phenotypic antibiotic resistance testing Disc assays experiments were performed and reported  in Urbaniak et\\u00a0 al. [51]. The isolates were streaked from  glycerol stocks onto R2A plates. A single colony was  inoculated into 5 mL Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) and grown  overnight at 30\\u00b0C. Aliquots of 100 \\u03bcL were plated on  TSA. Agar diffusion discs (BD BBLTM Sensi-DiscTM,  Franklin Lakes, NJ) were placed aseptically on a plate and  the strains were incubated at 37 \\u00b0C for 24 h. The tested  Page 10 of 12 Madrigal\\u00a0et\\u00a0al. Microbiome          (2022) 10:134  antibiotics included: 30-\\u03bcg cefazolin (CZ-30); 30-\\u03bcg  cefoxitin (FOX-30), 5 \\u03bcg ciprofloxacin (CIP-5), 15 \\u03bcg  erythromycin (E-15), 10-\\u03bcg gentamicin (GM-10), 1-\\u03bcg  oxacillin (OX), 10-\\u03bcg penicillin (P-10), 5-\\u03bcg rifampin  (RA-5), and 10 \\u03bcg tobramycin (NN-10). The diameter of  inhibition zones was measured for each antibiotic disk  and recorded in millimeters. The resistance results were  compared with the zone diameter interpretive charts  provided by the manufacturer. When the spontaneous  mutants were present in response to some antibiotics,  they were isolated, subcultured and tested for the specific  antibiotic resistance. Data availability Raw metagenomics reads from three flights on multi - ple locations were downloaded from NASA GeneLab  repository https:// genel  ab. nasa. gov (GLDS-69). The  ISS MAGs datasets are available at the SRA database  under the accession number: PRJNA438545 [https://   www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ biopr  oject/ PRJNA 438545/].  Microbial tracking-1 (MT-1) datasets (raw sequencing  data and sequence assembly files) were obtained from  GLDS-67, GLDS-302, GLDS-303, GLDS-309, GLDS- 311 and GLDS-350.

W. A. van Loon 2,3, Luigi Gennaro Izzo 1, Maurizio Iovane 1 &  Giovanna Aronne 1 Understanding the response of plants to varied gravitational conditions is vital for developing  effective food production in space bioregenerative life support systems. This study examines the  impact of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphological responses of Wolffia globosa  (commonly known as \\u201cwater lentils \\u201d or \\u201cduckweed\\u201d), assessing its potential as a space crop. Although  an experiment testing the effect of simulated microgravity on Wolffia globosa has been previously  conducted, for the first time, we investigated the effect of multiple gravity levels on the growth  and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa plants. The plant responses to simulated microgravity,  simulated partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity environments were evaluated using random  positioning machines and the large\\u2011diameter centrifuge. As hypothesized, we observed a slight  reaction to different gravitational levels in the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa.  The relative growth rates (RGR) of plants subjected to simulated microgravity and partial gravity  were reduced when compared to those in other gravity levels. The morphological analysis revealed  differences in plant dimensions and frond length\\u2011to\\u2011width ratios under diverse gravity conditions.  Our findings showed that Wolffia globosa is responsive to gravitational changes, with its growth and  morphological adaptations being slightly influenced by varying gravitational environments. As for  other crop species, growth was reduced by the microgravity conditions; however, RGR remained  substantial at 0.33 a day. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a  space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development  of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration  missions. Wolffia globosa, commonly known as \\u201c water lentils \\u201d is a member of the Wolffoideae  subfamily within the Lem - naceae  family, shares similar biological traits with its Lemnoideae  relatives: it is the smallest flowering plant and  shows the fastest growth rate in the plant kingdom and lacks a pseudo root  system1,2. Due to its rapid growth  rate, high protein content, and nutritional value, it has emerged as a promising candidate for sustainable food  production, particularly in agriculturally challenging  regions3\\u20136. This unique plant has recently garnered atten - tion also as a potential bioregenerative life support system (BLSS)  candidate7, offering traits that align with  closed-loop, resource-efficient systems like those adopted for the ESA MELiSSA  Loop8. Nevertheless, as for  other candidate space  crops9,10 to assess the suitability of Wolffia\\u2019s  in space cultivation and its ability to recycle  resources efficiently, further laboratory tests investigating growth, nutrition, and genetic responses under extreme  conditions are  fundamental7.OPEN 1Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, Portici, Italy. 2Department Oral and  Maxillofacial Surgery/Pathology, Amsterdam Movement Sciences and Amsterdam Bone Center (ABC), Amsterdam  University Medical Center Location VUmc and Academic Center for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA), Amsterdam,  The Netherlands. 3TEC-MMG-LIS Lab, European Space Agency (ESA) Technology Center (ESTEC), Noordwijk, The  Netherlands. *email: leoneermes.romano@unina.it 2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports  |          (2024) 14:410  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49680-3 www.nature.com/scientificreports/Studying the effects of various stimuli, including different gravity environments, radiations, and their inter - actions, on the growth and development of plants can be challenging and  costly7,11. Space limitations within  onboard test facilities, such as the International Space Station or orbiting vectors, often restrict the number of  replicates, making studies under these conditions even more  demanding12\\u201314. However, cost-effective alternatives  exist in the form of facilities that simulate microgravity and partial gravity levels by continuously altering the  gravitational  vector15\\u201317. These facilities offer higher replicate numbers and serve as robust testbeds for experi - ments involving different gravity  levels18,19. Hypergravity, characterized by gravitational forces greater than Earth\\u2019s standard 1\\u00a0g, is a significant factor in  space exploration, affecting humans, and plant  life20,21. Hypergravity is most prominent during the manuvers of  take-off and landing phases of spacecraft. These brief yet intense episodes of increased gravitational force can  influence various aspects of plant biology and  growth21. Understanding how plants respond to hypergravity is  essential for optimizing their cultivation in space environments and for Earth\\u2019s  agriculture22,23. Furthermore, it  provides valuable insights into the mechanisms plants employ to withstand and adapt to extreme gravitational   conditions24,25. Earlier studies under simulated microgravity have shown stable anatomical morphology in Wolffia   plants26,  possible effects of hypergravity on plant growth and reproduction have not yet been investigated. Testing plant  reactions of potential space crops under varying gravity levels, including those experienced during take-off,  landing, or in partial gravities, is reported as  crucial27. Consequently, exploring the adaptability of Wolffia  plants  under different gravitational conditions significantly contributes to our understanding of their  potential7. Recent genome sequencing of Wolffia australiana  has shed light on the gravity-sensing mechanisms and  photomorphogenesis in Wolffia   plants28,29. Due to the loss of gravity sensing genes in the sister species Wolffia  australiana , we also hypothesised for Wolffia globosa a lack of the gravity sensing mechanisms, resulting in a  reduced effect of the different gravity levels on the growth and morphological characteristics. More specifically, we aim to study the effects of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphology  of Wolffia globosa. Leveraging the capabilities of random positioning machines and large-diameter centrifuges,  we simulated microgravity, partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity conditions to comprehensively explore  the impact of varying gravitational environments on this plant species. These machines allow us to generate  and study a range of gravity conditions, thereby elucidating Wolffia globosa\\u2019s responses to these diverse gravity  environments and assessing its potential utilisation in space-based food production systems. Materials and methods Plant material and cultivation Plants of Wolffia globosa (9910) have been provided by Prof. Klaus Apperoth from the Department of Plant Physi- ology of the University of Jena, Germany. Upon receive, plant material was surface sterilised with 0.3% bleach/ water solution for 5\\u00a0  min30. After 14\\u00a0days from disinfection, plants were subcultured for 30\\u00a0days in N-medium30  under axenic conditions. Therefore, plant material has been transferred under a laminar flow hood in sets of  6-well plates, each filled with 5\\u00a0ml of N-medium solution and sealed with micropore\\u00ae tape. Before the experimen- tal run, plants were acclimatised for 24\\u00a0h at 30\\u00a0\\u00b0C. After acclimatisation, an average of 20  \\u00b1 4 fronds were trans - ferred in each well of a 6-multiwell plate previously filled with 5\\u00a0ml of N-medium and 0.8% of Agar to achieve  a semi-solid substrate. The experiment was conducted at 30 \\u00b1 0.5\\u00a0\\u00b0C average temperature with a photoperiod  of 16/8\\u00a0h light/dark and a total Photon Flux Density (PFD) of 72.37 \\u00b1 10.30\\u00a0\\u03bcmol  m\\u22122  s\\u22121 for 168\\u00a0  h2. Carbon  dioxide concentration has been monitored throughout the experiment, resulting in an average concentration  of 303  \\u00b1 34\\u00a0ppm. Hardware description and dimensions Experimental hardware has been developed to hold two multiwell plates in a setup that minimises the gravity gra- dient between the upper and lower multiwell plates. Furthermore, the experimental hardware had to be designed  to fit in most test facilities, setting the lower constraints to an overall dimension of 15*15*15\\u00a0cm of the smallest  Random Positioning Machine (RPM) available.. Considering these constraints, we designed and developed the  experimental hardware using the free available software SketchUp\\u00ae (Fig.\\u00a0 1). Due to the constraints described  before, multiwell plates had to be stacked vertically. This setup minimises the distance of the two centres of mass  of both multiwells so that the difference in acceleration can be neglected. The experimental hardware has been  equipped with LED white light (Goming LTD) to ensure proper plant development. Furthermore, 3\\u00a0cm 5\\u00a0V fans have been added to the experimental hardware to increase uniformity between the  temperature inside and outside the experimental hardware (Fig.\\u00a0 1). The prototype of the experimental hardware  has been built in plywood. Plywood has been laser cut, and parts have been glued in place with vinyl glue. The  template for laser cutting can be found in supplementary material Appendix A. Nevertheless, the experimental  hardware can be 3D printed in any plastic material, and information for the 3D model can be found on the  directory: GitHub. The inner dimension of each experimental hardware is designed to fit a multiwell plate of standard dimen - sions (12.7  \\u00d7 8.5 \\u00d7 2.2\\u00a0cm). From the multiwell lid to the lighting system, a fixed distance of 2.0\\u00a0cm has been set  up to guarantee optimal light intensity for plant growth. The experimental hardware\\u2019s design and dimensions  are reported below (Fig.\\u00a0 2). Lighting system Light treatment has been achieved utilising two 10\\u00a0cm 5\\u00a0V LED stripes illuminating each multiwell plate (Fig.\\u00a0 1).  Via USB connector, the light was connected to a Wi-Fi USB switch that controlled the lighting system and  photoperiod to a 16/8 light/dark cycle. Light emission spectrum has been determined with a spectroradiometer  3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports  |          (2024) 14:410  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49680-3 www.nature.com/scientificreports/(SS-110, Apogee Instruments Inc.) measuring in six different positions within the experimental hardware (N = 6)  in a wavelength range of 340\\u2013820\\u00a0nm. A more detailed composition of the light spectrum is described in Table\\u00a0 1  and Fig.\\u00a0 3. Gravity treatments The study encompassed four different gravity treatments: simulated microgravity, simulated partial gravity  (Moon), and two levels of hypergravity (2 g ad 4g ). In addition, a control group under Earth gravity conditions  was included for comparison (Fig.\\u00a0 4). Simulated microgravity (sim-\\u00b5g) was achieved using an RPM (Random Positioning Machine, original Dutch  Space Leiden, NL; currently Yuri Space, Meckenbeuren, DE) that allowed the plants to be positioned within  Figure\\u00a01.

The RPM was set to a maximum random speed of 60 \\u00b0/s, minimising residual   acceleration31. RPM was also set to random interval and random direction. Simulated Partial gravity (Moon) (sim-Moon) was simulated using a similar RPM, which was running a dif- ferent program which does not provide a complete random rotation during the experiment but generates vector  orientations and values that are biased such that the averaged resulted gravity vector simulates the Moon. This  proprietary software generated motion can enabled the examination of plant responses to partial gravity ranging  from nearly zero to 0.9\\u00a0g  levels27. Hypergravity conditions were obtained using the large-diameter centrifuge (LDC)32. Two hypergravity levels  were tested: 2g  and 4 g, corresponding to twice and four times the gravitational force on Earth, respectively. These  conditions allowed investigation of how Wolffia globosa responded to increased gravitational forces. A control group was included, where plants were grown under normal gravity conditions (1g ) in a static  gondola. This control group served as a baseline for comparing the growth and morphology of Wolffia globosa   under different gravity treatments.Table 1.  Light measurements.

Two imaging setups were used: Camera Setup: a Sony Alpha II camera with an 18\\u201370\\u00a0mm objective was fixed to a camera stand. It captured  top-down images of the multiwell plate placed on a lighting table with a white semi-transparent Polyvinyl chlo - ride panel illuminated by an LED light panel, ensuring uniform lighting conditions. The images thaken with this  setup were used to evaluate growth. Morespecificaly, the relative growth rate (RGR) was calculated by comparing  the area occupied by the plants in pixels at the start of the experiment (t0) and after 168\\u00a0h (t168). Doubling time  (DT) was determined based on RGR. Stereo Microscope Setup: detailed morphological analysis was performed using a Leica\\u00ae MZ8 Stereo zoom  Microscope. Images representing replicates for each treatment were captured. Images acquired with the stero - microscope were used to evaluate the morphological traits of Wolffia globosa were compared among gravity  treatments. Morphological traits, such as the dimensions of the long and short axes of the mother fronds, were  measured using Fiji\\u00ae software. Ratios between the long and short axes of the mother fronds were also calculated  to assess frond roundness. Image analysis has been performed on the images gathered during the experimental run. Two types of analysis  have been conducted: (1) Analysis of the growth parameters (RGR and DT) (2) Analysis of the morphological  differences. RGR has been calculated by comparing the area expressed in pixels occupied by the plant at two-time  intervals (N = 12). Images were analysed using the ilastik\\u00ae software described by Romano et\\u00a0al.33. We calculated  DT based on RGR as described by  Naumann34. To perform morphological comparison among treatments, one  hundred mother fronds have been randomly selected throughout the different wells of the same multiwell plate  within the same treatment. For coherent results, a phenological standard was determined. We have measured only  mother fronds that had a well-formed daughter frond still attached. Morphological traits have been evaluated  by measuring the long and short side of the mother frond. Long and short side have been always measured as  shown in Fig.\\u00a0 5. Furthermore, we have evaluated the existing ratios with respect to the long side between these  two measurements (N  = 100)26 (Fig.\\u00a0 5). Measurements have been taken utilising Fiji\\u00ae software. Image analysis data were processed and analysed using SPSS Statistics ver. 21 (IBM Corp.). Differences in  growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa among gravity treatments was assessed by one-way ANOV A  (p < 0.05). Pairwise comparisons were performed using Tukey\\u2019s post-hoc test (P  < 0.05) to identify differences  among individual treatments. IUCN policy statement Experimental studies and field research on plants (cultivated or wild), including the collection of plant material,  must comply with relevant institutional, national and international guidelines and legislation. We will strictly  adhere to the IUCN Policy Statement on Research on Endangered Species and the Convention on Trade in  Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Prof. Klaus Apperoth provided specimens in this utilised in this  study from the Department of Plant Physiology of the University of Jena, Germany and are available in the col - lection of the up mentioned university. We confirm compliance with the IUCN policy for plant. Results Relative growth rate (RGR) The analysis of variance (ANOV A) revealed a significant difference (F = 16.47, p  < 0.001) for the RGR among  the different gravity treatments. The Eta-squared and Epsilon-squared effect sizes indicated a large effect of the  treatments on the RGR (Eta-squared = 0.54, Epsilon-squared = 0.51). The post hoc \\u2019Tukey\\u2019s test, conducted to  determine the specific differences between the treatments, showed that the simulated microgravity treatment  (sim-\\u00b5g) (mean difference = 0.33, p < 0.001) had a significantly lower RGR (Fig.\\u00a0 6) compared to the control  treatment (1\\u00a0g) (mean difference = 0.38 \\u00b1 0.02). The simulated Moon partial gravity treatment (sim-Moon g)  also exhibited a lower RGR than the control treatment, but the difference was not statistically significant (mean  difference = 0.36, p = 0.25). In contrast, hypergravity treatments (2\\u00a0g and 4\\u00a0g) showed higher RGR compared to the control treatment.  However, there was no significant difference between the control and 2\\u00a0g hypergravity treatments (mean dif- ference = 0. 38, p = 0.99). The 4\\u00a0g hypergravity treatment (4\\u00a0g) showed the highest RGR among all treatments,  Table 2.

Furthermore, the doubling time is reported. The sim-\\u00b5g treatment exhibited the longest doubling time  of 2.18\\u00a0days, followed by the sim-Moon g, 1\\u00a0g, 2\\u00a0g, and 4\\u00a0g treatments with doubling times of 1.99, 1.83, 1.82,  and 1.82\\u00a0days, respectively (Fig.\\u00a0 7). Morphological difference Analysis of the morphological characteristics of Wolffia globosa fronds revealed differences in frond length  among the gravity treatments. Resulting in a variation in the length of both short and long axes. Results of the  ANOV A for the long side length showed a significant difference among gravity treatments (F = 17.34, p  < 0.001).  Results revealed that the fronds in the 1\\u00a0g treatment exhibited the longest length (mean = 0.76\\u00a0mm), followed  by the sim-Moon g treatment (mean = 0.76\\u00a0mm), the sim-\\u00b5g treatment (mean = 0.75\\u00a0mm), the 2\\u00a0g treatment  (mean = 0.73\\u00a0mm), and the 4\\u00a0g treatment (mean = 0.71\\u00a0mm) (Fig.\\u00a0 8). Similarly, for the short side length, a  significant main effect of gravity treatment was found (F  = 5.349, p  < 0.001). Post hoc tests showed that the  fronds in the sim-\\u00b5g treatment displayed the shortest length (mean  = 0.56\\u00a0mm), followed by the 4\\u00a0g treatment  (mean  = 0.57\\u00a0mm), the sim-Moon g treatment (mean  = 0.57\\u00a0mm), the 2\\u00a0g treatment (mean  = 0.58\\u00a0mm), and the  1\\u00a0g treatment (mean = 0.59\\u00a0mm). These results suggest that the gravity environment significantly affects the  MFDF SS LS Figure\\u00a05.  Wolffia globosa plant.

Analysis of the ratio in relation to the long side of Wolffia globosa  fronds revealed significant differences  among the different gravity treatments (F = 11.162, p  < 0.001).

While  the results revealed some variations in growth and morphological traits among the different gravity treatments,  these observations present exciting opportunities for further exploration and potential applications. In the realm of plant cultivation for space exploration (on orbital platforms, the Moon, and Mars), a more  profound comprehension of plant reactions to altered gravitational conditions is  essential16. Previous studies  have shown various effects of microgravity on the growth of several plant species, but research on the effects of  partial gravity and hypergravity on plants has been  limited15,18. The aid of facilities such as RPMs and LDC can  be the perfect testing ground before experimenting with true  microgravity18,19 and testing the effect of different  gravity levels on the performances of novel space crop  species7. Plants grown under microgravity conditions manifest a slower growth rate compared to those grown under  Earth\\u2019s  gravity35. Results from our investigation show that simulated microgravity and simulated Moon gravity  treatments resulted in slightly lower growth rates than the control treatment (Fig.\\u00a0 5). Although these differ - ences, it is important to note that the relative growth rates observed in these treatments were still substantial,  with the simulated microgravity treatment exhibiting a relative growth rate of 0.33 per day and the simulated  Moon partial gravity treatment exhibiting a relative growth rate of 0.36 per day while it was 0.38 per day in the  1\\u00a0g control plants. In addition, although reduced by the altered gravity conditions, growth rates of the Wolffia   plants remain higher than those typically observed in other higher plant  species36. Results from past experiments  show the relative growth rate over a span of 40\\u00a0days of lettuce grown under simulated microgravity, yielding a  rate of 0.08/day37. The effects of altered gravity, especially microgravity (whether real or simulated), on higher plant species have  been the subject of numerous scientific  studies38. Wolffia globosa is the smallest higher plant, and its morphology  is entirely distinct from other higher  plants39. It doesn\\u2019t exhibit the typical morphology of roots, stems, and leaves  but only has a frond that cannot be associated with any of the three main  organs39. The results of previous studies  on the effects of altered gravity on plant growth are not directly comparable to this species. Most of the research  conducted focuses on the interactions between microgravity and  roots10\\u201312,14,21. Wolffia globosa is famously  known as a rootless  plant39. To further complicate matters, their rootless nature makes comparison with what has  been studied so far challenging. Additionally, while microgravity has often been reported as a limiting growth  factor for  plants40\\u201342, results from tests performed under hypergravity are disagreeing. Studies on the nucleolar  activity or on the elongation of hypocotyls in both Arabidopsis thaliana  and Cucumis sativus, showed a decrease  in growth  rates43,44. At the same time, other results suggest that hypergravity might not affect  growth45. In our  experiment, the 2g  and 4 g hypergravity treatments manifest an increasing (although not statistically significant)  trend in growth rates compared to the control treatment (Fig.\\u00a0 6). This possible positive response to hypergravity  treatments opens up interesting possibilities for future studies and potential applications in space agriculture but  requires new ad hoc tests, eventually applying higher levels of hypergravity to amplify the phenomenon. In such  a scenario, hypergravity conditions could be leveraged to enhance plant productivity and biomass accumulation  in controlled environments, such as space stations. Considering that morphology plays a crucial role in plant growth, survival, and  productivity46, we investigated  the effect of different gravitational treatments on the shape of Wolffia globosa frond. Moreover, results revealed  significant differences among the treatments for both the long and short sides. Worth mentioning that such an  effect occurred on plants that can be considered genetically identical. The study findings revealed that the fronds of Wolffia globosa  were most extended in the 1\\u00a0g treatment, both  on the front and back sides. Subsequently, the sim-Moon g, sim-\\u00b5g, 2\\u00a0g, and 4\\u00a0g treatments followed in terms of  frond length. These results suggest that both simulated microgravity and simulated Moon\\u2019s partial gravity have  don\\u2019t have an impact on frond elongation. Furthermore, when analysing the ratio in relation to the longer side,  significant differences were observed among the gravity treatments, indicating distinct frond shapes. The sim-\\u00b5g  treatment resulted in the most elongated frond shape, followed by the sim-Moon g, 1\\u00a0g, 2\\u00a0g, and 4\\u00a0g treatments.  These findings provide compelling evidence supporting the significant influence of gravity on the morphological  characteristics of Wolffia globosa fronds. The observed variations in frond length and shape among the treat- ments underscore the role of gravity in shaping plant growth and development. Specifically, the sim-\\u00b5g treatment  consistently induced the most pronounced changes, suggesting its potential as a key factor in determining frond  morphology. These results contribute to our understanding of how different gravity environments impact the  growth and shape of Wolffia globosa, highlighting the importance of considering gravity conditions in cultivating  and manipulating these plants for various space applications. Understanding the underlying mechanisms driving  these morphological changes could provide valuable insights into the plant\\u2019s ability to perceive and respond to  gravitational cues. The adaptability of Wolffia globosa  to altered gravity conditions suggested by our data hints at the potential  use of plants from the genus Wolffia  in space agriculture. These plants, characterised by rapid growth and high  nutrient content, are strong candidates for food production in space, where resource constraints are  critical7,13.  Our findings further appraise the possible use of Wolffia globosa  for space exploration and the establishment of  sustainable agriculture in extraterrestrial environments. The robust growth and adaptability to altered gravity  conditions can be added to the small size, rapid growth rate, and high nutrient content, confirming that this genus  deserves consideration for cultivation in limited space and resource-constrained  environments7. Although Wolffia globosa exhibited a reduced growth rate in our experiment under simulated microgravity,  previous research has seen growth enactment of Wolffia globosa under simulated  microgravity26. As already  mentioned by the authors of the up-mentioned work, the enhanced growth might be linked to better utilisa- tion of dissolved oxygen and organic substances in the growth medium due to the type of cultivation system  they have  employed26. The varying responses observed among different gravity treatments in our experiment  9 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports  |          (2024) 14:410  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49680-3 www.nature.com/scientificreports/could be attributed to the interplay between genetic variability within the Lemnaceae family and the specific  environmental conditions experienced by each individual plant. Notably, the genus Wolffia  comprises numer - ous species with significant genetic diversity. Testing the effects of altered gravity on only one clone of Wolffia  globosa , as done in our experiment, provides a valuable starting point but may not fully capture the entire range  of responses within the genus Wolffia . Further investigations involving multiple Wolffia  species and clones are  warranted to explore the full extent of the species\\u2019 reaction to altered gravity and better understand the role of  genetic variability in shaping their growth patterns. The recent sequencing of the genome of Wolffia australiana  has provided valuable insights into the genetic  characteristics of Wolffia   species47. One intriguing finding is the absence of gravity-sensing genes commonly  observed in higher plants. More specifically, new findings have shed light on the missing LAZY proteins in  Wolffia australiana28. This genetic difference suggests that Wolffia  species have evolved alternative mechanisms  to perceive and respond to gravity cues, which may explain the distinct growth patterns exhibited under altered  gravitational conditions. Furthermore, to some degree, the enhanced growth rate seen under the hypergravity  treatment could be attributed to gravity resistance genes such as  PTH248. Our results partially confirmed the  expected limited reaction to gravity also of Wolffia globosa. The adaptability of Wolffia globosa to different gravi- tational conditions supported the hypothesis that the loss of gravity-sensing genes reported in the sister species  Wolffia australiana  might also occur in Wolffia globosa. The slight variations in growth rates and morphological  traits observed among the treatments open up interesting avenues for future research and potential applications  in space agriculture. In addition to its implications for space agriculture, this research also contributes to our understanding of  fundamental plant biology. The findings of our experiment might encourage further investigations to clarify  the evolutionary pathways that shaped the peculiar adaptation to gravity associated to a return to an ancestral  aquatic environment of Wolffia  genus.

In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration missions. Due to the loss of gravity sensing genes in the sister species Wolffia australiana , we also hypothesised for Wolffia globosa a lack of the gravity sensing mechanisms, resulting in a reduced effect of the different gravity levels on the growth and morphological characteristics. The different images show the implementation of the experimental hardware in the different gravity treatments.

Trehalose accumulation (Crowe et al. , 1998 ; Lapinski and Tunnacliffe, 2003 ), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins ( Goyal et al. , 2005 ; Kikawada et al. , 2006 ; MacRae, 2016 ), heat shock proteins (Cornette et al. , 2010 ; King and MacRae, 2015 ), and ROS scavenging ( Gusev et al. , 2010 ; Rizzo et al. , 2010 ) have been proposed as mechanisms of desiccation tolerance ( Janis et al. , 2018 ). We also investigated the tolerance to hyperosmotic stress by the expression of CAHS proteins, and found that the expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, or CAHS8 rendered the cells tolerant to the hyperosmotic stress. 2 and 3). (C–I) Representative images of HeLa cells overexpressing mEGFP (C), CAHS1- mEGFP (D), CAHS3-mEGFP (E), CAHS8-mEGFP (F), CAHS12-mEGFP (G), LEAM-mEGFP (H), and MAHS-mEGFP (I) proteins at the indicated time points. Although t-test was conducted for the data compared with the mEGFP data, the statistical significance was not observed.mEGFP protein, the CAHS3-mEGFP, the CAHS8-mEGFP, the CAHS12-mEGFP, the LEAM-mEGFP, the MAHS-mEGFP and the mEGFP were transfected into the HeLa cells with 293fectinTM Transfection Reagent (#12347-019, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). HeLa cells were plated on 96-well plates (7.5 × 102 – 3.0 × 103cells/well) (#167425, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and cultured in the assay medium for 24 h. To induce gene expression, the cells were treated with doxycycline for 24 h, followed by the treatment with sorbitol solution for 24 h. For the simultaneous cell viability assay and cell death assay ( Fig. Taken together, these results suggest that the resistance to hyperosmotic stress by LEAM and MAHS expression is not cell-wide protection as observed for CAHS proteins, so we focused on the CAHS proteins for our subsequent analyses.Osmotic stress resistance by CAHS1 expression Cell Structure and Function 49: 123–133 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1247/csf.24035 129 Cell Structure and FunctionCAHS1 expression renders HeLa cells resistant to hyperosmotic stress Recent studies have elucidated that the CAHS3 protein forms fibrillar aggregates under hyperosmotic conditions in mammalian cells, thereby enhancing their tolerance to hyperosmotic stress, as observed in Drosophila S2 cells ( Tanaka et al. , 2022 ). In addition, in this study, the single-cell clone of HeLa cells stably expressing CAHS1-mEGFP indicated lower IC50 values for cell viability and EC50 values for cell death in response to sorbitol stimulation in the absence of doxycycline than parental HeLa cells ( Fig. 2 and 3).  \n",
              "3  The results from this analysis highlight novel cellular Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 3 of 23 responses that may be relevant contributors to the combined e ects of microgravity and space radiation and therefore critical drivers of health risks from space radiation. The dose data for all spaceﬂight experiments, with the exception of GLDS-111, were from instruments available on the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. To compare the number of genes sets with the annotated gene sets, we provided heatmaps and clustering for all the datasets based on the NES for each molecular signature database collection for the analysis with the FDR <0.25 (Figure 4). To compare the number of genes sets with the annotated gene sets, we provided heatmaps and clustering for all the datasets based on the NES fo r each molecular signature database collection for the analysis with the FDR < 0.25 (Figure 4). Similar to the C5 GO analysis, we observed an increase in mitochondrial pathways as a function of dose. We observed these pathways to also be involved with our GSEA analysis as a function of dose. In our analysis on the C6 Oncogenic Signature database, we observed that PDGF and TGF were clustered together, purely on the basis of the statistics, and both were decreasing with increasing dose (cluster 3 in Figure 7C). The auto-annotated gene sets for each k-means cluster were then plotted with the NES versus the dose for associated for each GeneLab dataset (Table 1) with R-program ggplot2 (v3.2.1,).

A feature of the errors in pointing was that while increases in errors in HG and falls in MG were smaller relative to the NG value, compared with two-arm matching, all pointing errors lay further in the direction of extension of the arm, including the value for NG. For pointing and matching the trend of an increase in errors during hypergravity and a decrease during microgravity, relative to the normal gravity Data analysis For two-arm matching, the angles of the reference and indi - cator arms were recorded.

If, as a result of an increase in gravity, the position signal increases, this would be expressed in both arms, the reference arm sitting at 60° and the indicator moved by the participant. It suggested that in normal gravity there was an offset, in the direction of arm extension, in the measured values of point - ing errors. Certainly, the instructions to the participants were always to align the position of one arm with that of the other arm and no reference was made to gravity.  "

In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration missions. Due to the loss of gravity sensing genes in the sister species Wolffia australiana , we also hypothesised for Wolffia globosa a lack of the gravity sensing mechanisms, resulting in a reduced effect of the different gravity levels on the growth and morphological characteristics.

Trehalose accumulation (Crowe et al. , 1998 ; Lapinski and Tunnacliffe, 2003 ), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins ( Goyal et al. , 2005 ; Kikawada et al. , 2006 ; MacRae, 2016 ), heat shock proteins (Cornette et al. , 2010 ; King and MacRae, 2015 ), and ROS scavenging ( Gusev et al. , 2010 ; Rizzo et al. , 2010 ) have been proposed as mechanisms of desiccation tolerance ( Janis et al. , 2018 ). We also investigated the tolerance to hyperosmotic stress by the expression of CAHS proteins, and found that the expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, or CAHS8 rendered the cells tolerant to the hyperosmotic stress. 2 and 3).

Although t-test was conducted for the data compared with the mEGFP data, the statistical significance was not observed.mEGFP protein, the CAHS3-mEGFP, the CAHS8-mEGFP, the CAHS12-mEGFP, the LEAM-mEGFP, the MAHS-mEGFP and the mEGFP were transfected into the HeLa cells with 293fectinTM Transfection Reagent (#12347-019, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). HeLa cells were plated on 96-well plates (7.5 × 102 – 3.0 × 103cells/well) (#167425, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and cultured in the assay medium for 24 h. To induce gene expression, the cells were treated with doxycycline for 24 h, followed by the treatment with sorbitol solution for 24 h. For the simultaneous cell viability assay and cell death assay ( Fig. Taken together, these results suggest that the resistance to hyperosmotic stress by LEAM and MAHS expression is not cell-wide protection as observed for CAHS proteins, so we focused on the CAHS proteins for our subsequent analyses.Osmotic stress resistance by CAHS1 expression Cell Structure and Function 49: 123–133 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1247/csf.24035 129 Cell Structure and FunctionCAHS1 expression renders HeLa cells resistant to hyperosmotic stress Recent studies have elucidated that the CAHS3 protein forms fibrillar aggregates under hyperosmotic conditions in mammalian cells, thereby enhancing their tolerance to hyperosmotic stress, as observed in Drosophila S2 cells ( Tanaka et al. , 2022 ). In addition, in this study, the single-cell clone of HeLa cells stably expressing CAHS1-mEGFP indicated lower IC50 values for cell viability and EC50 values for cell death in response to sorbitol stimulation in the absence of doxycycline than parental HeLa cells ( Fig. 2 and 3).</td>\n",

To compare the number of genes sets with the annotated gene sets, we provided heatmaps and clustering for all the datasets based on the NES for each molecular signature database collection for the analysis with the FDR &lt;0.25 (Figure 4). To compare the number of genes sets with the annotated gene sets, we provided heatmaps and clustering for all the datasets based on the NES fo r each molecular signature database collection for the analysis with the FDR &lt; 0.25 (Figure 4). Similar to the C5 GO analysis, we observed an increase in mitochondrial pathways as a function of dose. We observed these pathways to also be involved with our GSEA analysis as a function of dose. In our analysis on the C6 Oncogenic Signature database, we observed that PDGF and TGF were clustered together, purely on the basis of the statistics, and both were decreasing with increasing dose (cluster 3 in Figure 7C). The auto-annotated gene sets for each k-means cluster were then plotted with the NES versus the dose for associated for each GeneLab dataset (Table 1) with R-program ggplot2 (v3.2.1,). Analysis on Common Individual Genes with Fold-Change Values and Fits as a Function of Dose A total of 19 spaceﬂight studies and 3 ground studies were selected from the GeneLab database.

              "      <td>It is proposed that the errors in matching and pointing are a consequence of the force of gravity acting at the elbow joint to alter the position signal coming from muscle and joint receptors. A feature of the errors in pointing was that while increases in errors in HG and falls in MG were smaller relative to the NG value, compared with two-arm matching, all pointing errors lay further in the direction of extension of the arm, including the value for NG. For pointing and matching the trend of an increase in errors during hypergravity and a decrease during microgravity, relative to the normal gravity Data analysis For two-arm matching, the angles of the reference and indi - cator arms were recorded.

Our observations suggest that of the three methods used in the present study, with the method of repositioning, it is not possible to reveal any disturbance of position sense by gravity and that if gravity effects were to be studied further, the preferred methods to use would have to be matching or pointing. * p &lt;.05; ** p &lt;.01 1 3127 Page 8 of 12 Experimental Brain Research (2025) 243:127by Bringoux et al. ( 2012 ) that during parabolic flight reach - ing errors were made with changes in gravity. If, as a result of an increase in gravity, the position signal increases, this would be expressed in both arms, the reference arm sitting at 60° and the indicator moved by the participant. It suggested that in normal gravity there was an offset, in the direction of arm extension, in the measured values of point - ing errors. Certainly, the instructions to the participants were always to align the position of one arm with that of the other arm and no reference was made to gravity.</td>\n",

In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration missions. Due to the loss of gravity sensing genes in the sister species Wolffia australiana , we also hypothesised for Wolffia globosa a lack of the gravity sensing mechanisms, resulting in a reduced effect of the different gravity levels on the growth and morphological characteristics. The different images show the implementation of the experimental hardware in the different gravity treatments.

The study findings revealed that the fronds of Wolffia globosa were most extended in the 1 g treatment, both on the front and back sides. The adaptability of Wolffia globosa to altered gravity conditions suggested by our data hints at the potential use of plants from the genus Wolffia in space agriculture. A. A.

A feature of the errors in pointing was that while increases in errors in HG and falls in MG were smaller relative to the NG value, compared with two-arm matching, all pointing errors lay further in the direction of extension of the arm, including the value for NG. For pointing and matching the trend of an increase in errors during hypergravity and a decrease during microgravity, relative to the normal gravity Data analysis For two-arm matching, the angles of the reference and indi - cator arms were recorded.

Our observations suggest that of the three methods used in the present study, with the method of repositioning, it is not possible to reveal any disturbance of position sense by gravity and that if gravity effects were to be studied further, the preferred methods to use would have to be matching or pointing. * p <.05; ** p <.01 1 3127 Page 8 of 12 Experimental Brain Research (2025) 243:127by Bringoux et al. ( 2012 ) that during parabolic flight reach - ing errors were made with changes in gravity. If, as a result of an increase in gravity, the position signal increases, this would be expressed in both arms, the reference arm sitting at 60\\u00b0 and the indicator moved by the participant. It suggested that in normal gravity there was an offset, in the direction of arm extension, in the measured values of point - ing errors. Certainly, the instructions to the participants were always to align the position of one arm with that of the other arm and no reference was made to gravity.\",\n          \"Key words anhydrobiosis, Tardigrades, live imaging, disordered proteins, desiccation tolerance Cell Structure and Function 49: 123\\u2013133 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1247/csf.24035 123 Cell Structure and FunctionIntroduction Anhydrobiosis, derived from \\u201clife without water \\u201d in Greek, is a phenomenon where an organism loses almost all of its water and enters a state of reversible ametabolism ( Crowe et al. , 1998 ; Keilin, 1959 ). Trehalose accumulation (Crowe et al. , 1998 ; Lapinski and Tunnacliffe, 2003 ), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins ( Goyal et al. , 2005 ; Kikawada et al. , 2006 ; MacRae, 2016 ), heat shock proteins (Cornette et al. , 2010 ; King and MacRae, 2015 ), and ROS scavenging ( Gusev et al. , 2010 ; Rizzo et al. , 2010 ) have been proposed as mechanisms of desiccation tolerance ( Janis et al. , 2018 ). We also investigated the tolerance to hyperosmotic stress by the expression of CAHS proteins, and found that the expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, or CAHS8 rendered the cells tolerant to the hyperosmotic stress. 2 and 3). (C\\u2013I) Representative images of HeLa cells overexpressing mEGFP (C), CAHS1- mEGFP (D), CAHS3-mEGFP (E), CAHS8-mEGFP (F), CAHS12-mEGFP (G), LEAM-mEGFP (H), and MAHS-mEGFP (I) proteins at the indicated time points. Although t-test was conducted for the data compared with the mEGFP data, the statistical significance was not observed.mEGFP protein, the CAHS3-mEGFP, the CAHS8-mEGFP, the CAHS12-mEGFP, the LEAM-mEGFP, the MAHS-mEGFP and the mEGFP were transfected into the HeLa cells with 293fectinTM Transfection Reagent (#12347-019, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). HeLa cells were plated on 96-well plates (7.5 \\u00d7 102 \\u2013 3.0 \\u00d7 103cells/well) (#167425, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and cultured in the assay medium for 24 h. To induce gene expression, the cells were treated with doxycycline for 24 h, followed by the treatment with sorbitol solution for 24 h. For the simultaneous cell viability assay and cell death assay ( Fig. Taken together, these results suggest that the resistance to hyperosmotic stress by LEAM and MAHS expression is not cell-wide protection as observed for CAHS proteins, so we focused on the CAHS proteins for our subsequent analyses.Osmotic stress resistance by CAHS1 expression Cell Structure and Function 49: 123\\u2013133 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1247/csf.24035 129 Cell Structure and FunctionCAHS1 expression renders HeLa cells resistant to hyperosmotic stress Recent studies have elucidated that the CAHS3 protein forms fibrillar aggregates under hyperosmotic conditions in mammalian cells, thereby enhancing their tolerance to hyperosmotic stress, as observed in Drosophila S2 cells ( Tanaka et al. , 2022 ). In addition, in this study, the single-cell clone of HeLa cells stably expressing CAHS1-mEGFP indicated lower IC50 values for cell viability and EC50 values for cell death in response to sorbitol stimulation in the absence of doxycycline than parental HeLa cells ( Fig. 2 and 3).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. Weidentify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1 )e n c o d i n ga nE T H Y L E N E - INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative genefor the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2(OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls theproduction of reactive oxygen species i n the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localizatio n of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentlemechanical resistance to root tips, inc luding growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosen sing-induced calcium signaling is required and suf ﬁcient for antagonizing the eth ylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unantici pated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism. The terrestrial colonization of plants is a critical milestone in the Earth ’s evolution history, dramatically increasing the productivity of organic carbon on land to support highly diverse ecosystems1,2.T h e emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a criticalevolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the soil andabsorb water and nutrients 3. Root gravitropism features perception of gravity by the root cap and directional growth regulation mediated byauxin 4. In gravity-oriented roots, symmetrical distribution of auxin in root tips maintain symmetrical growth5. When root growth deviates from the direction of gravity, the amyloplasts in the columella cells ofthe root cap rapidly sink to the plasma membrane at the bottom,triggering the activation of gravity response via LAZY proteins 6,7.S u c h response entails relocation of the auxin exporter PIN-FORMED (PIN) inthe cells and redistribution of auxin8–10, thus promoting asymmetric auxin ﬂow and asymmetric cell growth to bend the root tip to the gravity direction11. Mutations in auxin transporters and gravity- signaling-related proteins often lead to defective root gravitropismduring vertical growth, such as root tips growing toward randomdirections 7,12,13,w a v yr o o t s14, and enlarged root angles15,16. The gaseous plant hormone ethylene plays crucial roles in plant development, senescence, and stress resistance17,18.E t h y l e n eb i o - synthesis and signaling are induced by speci ﬁc conditions or stresses, including ﬂooding, drought, low temperatures, and pathogens18.

When the stress signal fades and the ethylene level goes down, EIN3/EILs are degraded by the EIN3-BINDING F-box protein 1/2 (EBF1/2) mediated ubiquitination/ proteasome pathway27,28. Although ethylene is indispensable for plants, high level of ethy- lene is adverse for root growth29. In compacted soil, diffusion of ethylene away from roots is limited, resulting in the accumulation ofethylene and inhibition of root penetration into the soil 30.E t h y l e n e inhibits root elongation by interacting with other plant hormones,such as auxin and abscisic acid 31. For example, excess ethylene enhances auxin biosynthesis and promotes Auxin Response Factors(ARFs)-mediated transcriptional regulation to affect cell wall compo-sition, thereby limiting the elongation of root cells 32,33. Excess ethylene also weakens root gravitropic response by affecting auxin biosynthesis34,35. In addition, some auxin signaling and transport mutants exhibit both defective gravitropic phenotypes and insensi-tivity to ethylene 36,37. However, the speci ﬁc mechanism whereby ethylene signaling controls gravitropic growth remains unclear. In this study, we isolated an intriguing rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponic culture but normal gravitropic growth insoil. The mutated gene represents a loss-of-function allele for the EIN3-binding F-box protein OsCRW1/OsEBF1, leading to overaccumulationof the OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and ampli ﬁed ethylene signaling. We show that OsEIL1/2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82, which subsequently regulates the transcription of several genes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overaccumulation ofROS in the root tip leads to premature loss of the root cap structure,impaired polar localization of OsPIN2 and auxin distribution, resultingin severely impaired gravitropism. In the soil-grown plants, however,gravitropism is restored in a mechanosensing-induced calciumsignaling-dependent manner, revealing an intricate regulation ofgravitropism by crosstalk between ethylene signaling andmechanosensing. Results crw1 roots coil in water but not in soil We screened an ethyl methylsulfonate-mutagenized population (approximately 5000 lines) of the rice ( Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Zhonghua11 and isolated a mutant with root coiling phenotype wheng r o w ni nh y d r o p o n i cc u l t u r e( F i g . 1a, Supplementary Movie 1). Both seminal and adventitious roots of the mutant coiled in the root tipregion, resulting in a shorter root depth compared to the wild type(WT, Supplementary Fig. 1). Changes in nutrient supply, solution pH,aeration (dissolved oxygen level), and exposure to light did not alterthe root coiling phenotype of the mutant in hydroponic culture(Supplementary Fig. 2). When grown in water-saturated solid media (e.g. paddy soil, soil-vermiculite mixture, vermiculite and peat pellet), however, the root coiling phenotype disappeared (Fig. 1aa n dS u p - plementary Fig. 3). We named the mutant coiling root in water (crw1). In contrast to the distinctive root phenotype, shoots of crw1 grew normally in hydroponics (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Plants were grownto maturity in two paddy ﬁelds. In one paddy ﬁeld, no signi ﬁcant dif- ference was observed between crw1 and WT in any of the agronomic traits determined at plant maturity (Supplementary Fig. 4c –h), whereas in the other ﬁeld there was a small and signi ﬁcant reduction in the percentage of ﬁlled grains and grain biomass per plant in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 4i –n). crw1 exhibits smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and defective gravitropic response in hydroponic T h ec o i l i n gp h e n o t y p eo f crw1 suggests that it may be a gravitropic mutant. Compared with WT, crw1 had a smaller root cap (Fig. 1b) and fewer amyloplasts in the root tip (Fig. 1c). When roots were placedhorizontally, crw1 responded less sensitively to gravity than WT and started to coil at 6 h after horizontal placement (Fig. 1d, e and Sup- plementary Fig. 5), indicating impaired gravitropic response. Auxin distribution is crucial for root gravitropism11.T oe x a m i n e the auxin distribution in the root tip, we introduced the auxin reporter DR5rev::VENUS into WT and crw1. When grown in water (Fig. 1g), WT roots showed symmetrical auxin distribution, whereas crw1 showed asymmetric auxin distribution at different stages of coiling (Fig. 1g). When WT roots were placed horizontally, gravity triggered rapidaccumulation of auxin on the bottom side of the root tip, causing it togrow towards the gravity direction; once the root tip grew in thegravity direction, symmetrical auxin distribution was restored (Sup-plementary Fig. 6a). In contrast, crw1 exhibited an asymmetric auxin distribution at all stages under gravitational stimulation (Supplemen-tary Fig. 6b). As expected, asymmetric auxin distribution led to asymmetric cell length on the two sides of the root tip (Supplementary Fig. 7a –c). Compared to WT, crw1 had a shorter meristem and fewer meristem cells (Supplementary Fig. 7d, e). Staining with 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) showed a lower proliferation of meristem cells incrw1 than WT (Supplementary Fig. 7f, g). Applying the auxin bio- synthesis inhibitor L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn) or removing the root capresulted in a more even auxin distribution (indicated by DR5rev::VE- NUS) and rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplemen- tary Fig. 8). InArabidopsis thaliana , symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip is maintained by the auxin exporter PIN2, which is polarly localized on the top of the root epidermal cells to allow the shootward ﬂow of auxin from the root tip 12. This pattern of polar localization is conserved in seed plants3. To examine the localization of OsPIN2 in the root tip, we introduced OsPIN2-GFP driven by its native promoter ( pOsPI- N2::OsPIN2-GFP )i n t oW Ta n d crw1 by crossing. OsPIN2-GFP was polarly localized in the epidermal cells in WT, whereas such polarity was lost incrw1 (Fig. 1h), which is consistent with the asymmetric auxin dis- tribution observed in crw1 root tips. When grown in soil, all phenotypes of the mutant, including root coiling, root cap size, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, andgravity response, were rescued to similar levels observed in WT (Fig. 1a–h and Supplementary Fig. 5). Taken together, these data sug- gest that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water is caused by a smaller root cap size with fewer amyloplasts and asymmetric auxindistribution resulted from OsPIN2 mis-localization. Cloning the causative gene of crw1 To clone the causal gene for the crw1 phenotype, we backcrossed WT (paternal) with crw1 (maternal). All F 1plants showed the straight-root phenotype in water (Supplementary Fig. 9a), and the F 2progeny seg- regated into 340 and 119 straight and coiling-root, respectively, whichis consistent with a 3:1 ratio ( χ 2= 0.002, P= 0.966) (Supplementary Fig. 9b), indicating that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 resulted from recessive mutation of a single gene. We conducted genomicresequencing mapping and Mut-Map analysis on the F 2progeny and identi ﬁed three candidate genes, Os06g0604400 ,Os06g0605900 , and Os06g0619600 (Supplementary Fig. 9c, d). Complementation tests identi ﬁedOs06g0605900 as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype, which we name COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (OsCRW1) (Fig. 2a–d and Supplementary Fig. 9e, f). Compared to WT, a 3681-bp fragment deletion was identi ﬁed in the promoter and a portion of the open reading frame of crw1 allele, resulting in a total loss of tran- scription (Fig. 2a, b). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of OsCRW1 (oscrw1KO) in WT also generated the same root coiling phenotype in water, which disappeared in soil (Fig. 2e, f and Supplementary Fig. 10a). The three oscrw1KOlines also showed smaller root caps and asymmetric auxin distribution in the root tips when grown in water, and thesedefective phenotypes were rescued when plants were grown in soil(Supplementary Fig. 10b, c).Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Nature Communications |         (2025) 16:3712 2 Analysis of transgenic plants expressing pOsCRW1::GFP and pOsCRW1::GUS showed that OsCRW1 was expressed in both roots and shoots (Fig. 2g ,ha n dS u p p l e m e n t a r yF i g .1 1 ) .I nr o o t s , OsCRW1 was strongly expressed in root tips, especially in the root cap (Fig. 2g, h).

To examine whether loss of function of OsEBF2 affects gravitropism, we knocked out OsEBF2 in the WT background using CRISPR/Cas9. No effect on root growth and gravitropism wasfound (Supplementary Fig. 12a, b). Knockout of OsEBF2 incrw1 did not exacerbate the root coiling phenotype in water, and also did not affectthe phenotype recovery in soil (Supplementary Fig. 12c, d), suggestingthat OsEBF2, unlike OsCRW1/OsEBF1, does not play a role in rootgravitropism. We performed RNA-seq analysis on WT and crw1 roots grown in water or soil. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs)between crw1 and WT grown in water, ethylene-responsive genes were strongly enriched, with 30 of the 32 DEGs being signi ﬁcantly upregu- lated in crw1, including 20 ethylene response transcription factors (ERFs) (Fig. 3a, b). When grown in soil, the number of DEGs between crw1 and WT decreased to 5, with 2 ethylene-related genes being upregulated in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 13). Application of 1-MCP, an ethylene response inhibitor, totally rescuedthe phenotypes of smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution androot coiling in crw1 and three oscrw1 KOlines in water (Fig. 3c–f), sug- gesting that excessive ethylene response leads to the root coiling phenotype. The above ﬁndings support the notion that OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may, likeArabidopsis AtEBF1, function in the degradation of core ethylene response transcription factors27,28. These may include OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that are rice homologs of AtEIN3/EIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 14a),the central transcriptional factors controlling the activation of ethy-lene signaling and targets of AtEBF1 41,42. We investigated whether OsCRW1 interacts with OsEIL1/OsEIL2 proteins. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H)and bimolecular ﬂuorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that OsCRW1 physically interacted with OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 (Supple-mentary Fig. 14b, c). We generated transgenic plants expressingpOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag orpOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag in WT, and introduced these transgenes into crw1 by crossing. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated much higher levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 than WTwhen grown in water, but the differences largely disappeared wheng r o w ni ns o i l( F i g . 4a, b).

In contrast, WT roots grown in a highly compactedsoil (bulk density = 1.6 g cm −3) exhibited an elevated level of OsEIL1, indicating an increased ethylene consistent with the report by Pandey et al.30Next, we knocked out OsEIL1 (oseil1KO/crw1 )o rOsEIL2 (oseil2KO/ crw1)i ncrw1 by using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplementary Fig. 14d, e), which essentially rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water (Fig. 4c, d), with the effect being greater in oseil1KO/crw1 than in oseil2KO/crw1 . These results indicate that loss of function of OsCRW1/ OsEBF1 leads to overaccumulation of both OsEIL1 and OsEIL2, causingthe root coiling phenotype in water, with OsEIL1 playing a larger rolethan OsEIL2. Next, we overexpressed OsEIL1 orOsEIL2 driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter, increasing the transcription of the two genes by 16-22- and 52-57-fold, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 16a, b). When grown in water, OsEIL1 andOsEIL2 overexpressing lines showed shorter and slightly curved roots compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 16c).Addition of a small dose of the ethylene precursor ACC (1 μM) in water decreased root growth of WT slightly but caused OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines to coil in the root tip region, a phenotyperesembling crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 16d). Overexpression of OsEIL1 orOsEIL2 alone did not cause root coiling, likely because OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 is degraded in the presence of functional OsCRW1/OsEBF1. Incontrast, enhanced ethylene concentration from ACC addition mayrepress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and thus stabilize OsEIL1and OsEIL2 proteins, as has been shown in Arabidopsis 43.W h e ng r o w n in soil, the shorter and curvy roots of OsEIL1 andOsEIL2 overexpressing lines were largely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 16e). OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82 To search for the direct target genes downstream of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2that cause root coiling in crw1, we analyzed the expression pattern of all of the 139 ERFgenes from the transcriptomic data. We expected that the transcriptional levels of the target genes should match the phe-notype changes, i.e. elevated in crw1 only in water but reduced in soil. When grown in water, 20 ERFgenes were expressed at higher levels in crw1 roots than WT (Supplementary Fig. 17a). When grown in soil, 17 of these 20 ERFgenes were equally highly expressed in both WT and crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 17b), suggesting that these 17 ERFgenes may not be related to the root coiling phenotype of crw1. The three remaining ERFgenes, OsERF2 (Os06g0181700 ),OsERF81 (Os02g0520000 )a n d OsERF82 (Os04g0399800 )w e r es i g n i ﬁcantly downregulated in both WT and crw1 when grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 17b). These ERF genes are potential candidate genes targeted by OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 andassociated with the occurrence of the root coiling phenotype (Sup-plementary Fig. 17b, c and Fig. 4e). We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the three ERF genes individually in the crw1 background (Supple- mentary Fig. 17d –f) and found that disruption of OsERF82 (oserf82 KO/ crw1) rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water to a large extent (Fig. 4f, g), whereas knockout of OsERF2 orOsERF81 had no effect (Supplementary Fig. 17g, h). The OsERF82 protein was localizedin the nucleus and exhibited transactivation activity (SupplementaryFig. 18a, b). We used yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoreticmobility shift assay (EMSA) to demonstrate that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2could speci ﬁcally bind to the EIN3-binding sites (EBS, ATGTA) in the promoter region (2.5 Kb) of OsERF82 (Fig. 4h–j and Supplementary Fig. 18c). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR of pOsEIL1::O- sEIL1-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 transgenic plants showed that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 bound to the EBS sequences in theOsERF82 promoter in vivo (Fig. 4k, l). Furthermore, knockout of OsEIL1 orOsEIL2 incrw1 largely abolished the upregulation of OsERF82 expression when grown in water (Fig. 4m). Taken together, the tran- scription factor OsERF82 acts as a direct target of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 toamplify ethylene signaling and cause root coiling of crw1 in water.T h ec o m p l e t er e s c u eo ft h e crw1 phenotype in oseil1/crw1 but the incomplete rescue in oserf82 KO/crw1 suggests that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also be involved. OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS nexus controls gravitropism In addition to the ethylene signaling pathway, RNA-seq showed thatgenes related to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were alsoenriched in crw1 when grown in water but not in soil (Fig. 3aa n d Supplementary Fig. 19a), suggesting that ROS may be involved in theroot coiling phenotype. Among the DEGs between crw1 and WT, a ROS- responsive gene Bsr-d1/ZFP36 , a respiratory burst oxidase homolog enzyme gene ( RBOHH ) and four class III peroxidase genes were upre- gulated in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 19b). It has been shown OsRBOHH is involved in ROS production in rice roots 44. The Class III peroxidases are also possibly involved in ROS production in multiple and func- tionally redundant ways45. To examine whether ROS is involved in the root coiling phenotype, we used the ROS ﬂuorescent probe H 2DCFDA to monitor root ROS levels in WT and crw1 grown in water. Compared with WT, the ROS level in the root tips of crw1 was elevated dramati- cally, especially in the coiling region and the sloughing root cap cells(Fig. 5a). Aeration of hydroponic solution had no effect on the ROS level in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 20). When grown in soil or vermi- culite, ROS in crw1 roots returned to a low level comparable to that in WT, corresponding to the recovery of the root phenotype (Supple-mentary Fig. 19c, d). Increased programmed cell death was observed inthe root cap cells of crw1 grown in water by the TUNEL assay (Fig. 5b), which was likely induced by excess ROS 46and explained why crw1 had a smaller root cap than WT. Application of the ROS scavengerN-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), the RBOH inhibitor diphenyleneio- donium (DPI, 50 nM), or the inhibitor of the class III peroxidase sali-cylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) in water reduced ROS in crw1 roots to the level comparable to that in WT (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 19e, f), prevented the excessive programmed cell death andsloughing of the root cap cells, and largely rescued the root coilingphenotype (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 19g, h). Furthermore, clearance of ROS restored the polar localization of OsPIN2 and sym-metric distribution of auxin in the root tips of crw1 (Fig. 5d, e). Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced ROS generation, likely by RBOHs and PRXs, causes root coiling in crw1 by accelerating sloughing of root cap cells and impairing OsPIN2 localization. To establish the causal relationship between excess ROS and the ampli ﬁed OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 roots, we grew WT, crw1, oseil1 KO/crw1 lines, oseil2KO/crw1 lines, and oserf82KO/crw1 lines in water and examined the ROS level in root tips. Knockout of OsEIL1 ,OsEIL2 ,o r OsERF82 incrw1 decreased ROS to a similar level as in WT (Fig. 5f–h), suggesting that the ampli ﬁed OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 leads to excessive ROS generation in the root tip. To explore howenhanced OsERF82 promotes ROS production, we found that the promoter regions (approximately 3 Kb) of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Os09g0323700, Os06g06 95400 and Os07g0638600) contain potential ERF binding sites, including DRE/CRT (GCCGAC),GCC-box (GCCGCC) and G-box (CACGTG) 47(Supplementary Fig. 21a). The Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay(EMSA) demonstrated that OsERF82 speci ﬁcally bound to the binding sites of the DRE/CRT, GCC-box and G-box in the promoter region ofOsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the transcriptional levels of OsRBOHH and the three Class III OsPRX genes were upregulated in crw1 root tips compared with those in WT (Supplementary Fig. 21d), whereasknockout of OsEIL1 ,OsEIL2 orOsERF82 incrw1 suppressed the upre- gulation of these genes (Supplementary Fig. 21d). Taken together, ampli ﬁed OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 causes ROS accumulation in crw1 root tips likely by promoting the transcription of OsRBOHH and Class III OsPRX genes.Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Nature Communications |         (2025) 16:3712 7 Mechanical resistance on the root tip rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 After identifying ampli ﬁed ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/2- OsERF82 leading to ROS overproduction as the cause of impairedgravitropism in crw1, we explored the mechanism underlying the res- cue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 when plants were grown inwater-saturated paddy soil and other solid media (Supplementary Fig. 3). These solid media were soft and had a penetration resistance of 35-67 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 3a), which is 25-47 folds smaller than thatin the same paddy soil unsaturated with water (moisture content 20%)and compacted to a bulk density of 1.6 g cm −3(i.e. a condition similar to that used in the study of Pandey et al.30).

These results suggestthat a gentle mechanical resistance of ≥34 Pa is suf ﬁcient to rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1. To further examine the effect of mechanical resistance, we attached a polystyrene foam pellet (1-mm diameter) to the root tip ofcrw1 grown in water, which applied a mechanical stimulus to the root tip through the buoyance of water against the foam pellet (Fig. 6d). The pellet was open at the top to allow normal gas diffusion. Theresistance of the foam pellet to the root tip was estimated to beapproximately 104 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 23). The attachment offoam pellet did not affect the root cap size and symmetric auxin dis-tribution in WT, but largely rescued the root cap size, auxin distribu-tion and the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 24 and Fig. 6e, f), indicating that the root tip is the site for sensing mechanical stimulus which rescues the loss of gravitropism in crw1. Soil compaction may restrict ethylene diffusion away from plant roots, thus amplifying ethylene signaling and inhibiting root growth 30. We compared root growth of WT and crw1 in a paddy soil packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3)a n dah i g h( 1 . 6gc m−3) bulk density. Both levels of bulk density restored the coiling root phenotype of crw1 to straight roots. At 1.0 bulk density, WT, crw1 and two oscrw1KOmutants showed similar root length (Supplementary Fig. 25). Increasing bulk density to1.6 decreased the root length of WT by 36% and of crw1 and two oscrw1 KOmutants by 47-51% (Supplementary Fig. 25). The larger inhi- bition in crw1 is consistent with the heightened ethylene signaling. Mechanosensing rescuing crw1 phenotype requires calcium signaling in the root cap Calcium (Ca2+) is a critical signal in plant responses to mechanical stimuli48,49.T oi n v e s t i g a t ew h e t h e rC a2+signaling is involved in the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1,w ee x p r e s s e d NES- YC3.650, a cytosolic Ca2+([Ca2+]cyt) reporter gene, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter in WT and then introduced the gene into crw1 through crossing. The root caps of both WT and crw1 growing in four different solid media showed a signi ﬁcantly higher [Ca2+]cytsignal than those growing in water, and there were no signi ﬁcant differences between WT and crw1 (Fig. 7a, b). Similarly, the [Ca2+]cytsignal remained low in the root caps of both WT and crw1 when grown in 0.3% and 0.4% agar, and increased signi ﬁcantly when both were grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Supplementary Fig. 26). These results suggest that agentle mechanical resistance of approximately ≥34 Pa enhances [Ca 2+]cytin the root cap and beyond this threshold there is no further increase in [Ca2+]cyt. Moreover, loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 does not affect [Ca2+]cytin the root cap or its response to mechanical resistance. To investigate whether the enhanced Ca2+signal in the root cap is involved in the recovery of crw1 ’s phenotypes, we applied 100 μM LaCl 3,aC a2+channel blocker, to 0.8% agar. We found that LaCl 3sup- pressed [Ca2+]cytin the root caps (Fig. 7c, d) and largely abolished the rescue effect of mechanical resistance on the root cap size and auxindistribution (Fig. 7e, f). Importantly, the addition of LaCl 3abolished the recovery of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Fig. 7g and Supplementary Fig. 27), indicating the root cap calcium signal triggered by mechanosensing is required for the rescue ofgravitropism in crw1. The observation that growing in soil prevented overaccumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in crw1 roots (Fig. 4a, b) suggests that mechanosensing-Ca 2+signaling may rescue the root coiling phenotype ofcrw1 by limiting the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 when grown in 0.4% agar, and accumulation of the two proteins was sup-pressed to the WT levels when grown in 0.8% agar (Fig. 7h, i). Addition of 100 μML a C l 3to 0.8% agar suppressed [Ca2+]cytin the root caps, r e s u l t i n gi na no v e r - a c c u m u l a t i o no fO s E I L 1a n dO s E I L 2i nt h e crw1roots (Fig. 7h, i). There were no signi ﬁcant differences in the transcript levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 between WT and crw1 in different agar concentrations or between 0.8% agar with and without addition ofLaCl 3(Supplementary Fig. 28), su ggesting that the effect of mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling on the protein levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 is not related to transcriptional regulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 . Furthermore, upregulation of OsERF82 and excess ROS pro- duction in crw1 roots were observed when grown in 0.4% agar but not in 0.8% agar, whereas the addition of LaCl 3to 0.8% agar medium sig- niﬁcantly increased OsERF82 transcription and ROS accumulation in crw1 roots (Fig. 7j and Supplementary Fig. 29). In WT roots, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins were kept at low levels because of the presence ofOsCRW1, which likely explains the lack of response of OsERF82 tran- scription and ROS level to mechano-sensing induced Ca 2+signaling in WT. These results suggest that mechano-sensing induced Ca2+signal- ing inhibits the ampli ﬁed module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS in crw1, and rescues the root cap structure, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and consequently gravitropism. The root coiling phenotype in hydroponics occurs in natural rice accessions Rice roots show considerable natural variation in the growth pheno- type when grown in hydroponics. During the screen of a panel of 230rice accessions consisting mainly of landraces in the lower YangtzeRiver delta in China, we found that 53, 46 and 131 accessions exhibitedthe root coiling, straight root, and intermediate phenotypes, respec- tively, when grown in water (Supplementary Fig. 30a). We randomly selected 8 accessions each with coiling or straight roots (Supplemen-tary Fig. 30b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the group of rootcoiling accessions had a signi ﬁcantly lower level of OsCRW1 transcript than the group with straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30d). Additionof 1-MCP to water straightened the coiling roots (SupplementaryFig. 30e), suggesting the phenotype in these rice accessions is likelycaused by enhanced ethylene signaling. When grown in water-saturated paddy soil, the root coiling phenotype was completely res-cued (Supplementary Fig. 30f), which is consistent with the phenotyperecovery of crw1. In highly compacted soil, coiling-root accessions showed shorter root elongation than straight-root accessions, which is consistent with the phenotypes of crw1 and WT, respectively (Sup- plementary Fig. 30g). Discussion Ethylene plays a critical role in plant growth, development and resis-tance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Because ethylene bio-synthesis ﬂuctuates widely under the in ﬂuence of changing environments 18,51, its effect on gravitropic growth of roots must be tightly regulated. In this study, by dissecting the genetic basis for theroot coiling phenotype in the rice mutant crw1, we uncovered the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1)-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots (Fig. 8). Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescuedroot coiling phenotype of crw1, we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling,thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig. 8). The gravitropic growth of roots depends on the perception of gravity by the root cap and the symmetric distribution of auxin in theroot tip. The former requires amyloplast as the gravity responder totransmit the gravity signal via LAZY proteins 6,7, and the latter is tightly controlled by polar-localized auxin transporters such as PIN212.M u t a - tions of critical genes in auxin transport (e.g. pin212,aux113,eir136), amyloplast synthesis52,53and gravity signaling6,7cause plant roots to display defective gravitropic behaviors during vertical growth. Theimpact of ethylene signaling on root gravitropism appears to varyamong plant species. In Arabidopsis , loss-of-function mutations of the key genes that control ethylene biosynthesis or signal transduction,Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Nature Communications |         (2025) 16:3712 10 including ETO1 ,CTR1, EIN2, andEIN3, did not affect gravitropic growth of roots35. In contrast, disruption of EIL1andEIN2 homologous genes in rice or maize resulted in enlarged angle of adventitious roots when grown in hydroponic, indicating a weakened gravitropism35.I nt h e present study, we found that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led tocoiling of both seminal and adventitious roots of rice in hydroponicculture, indicative of a severe disruption of gravitropism. The F-boxproteins EBFs bind to EIN3 and EIL proteins, thus promoting theirdegradation via a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway 27,28. The loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to overaccumulation of OsEIL1/2proteins in rice roots and consequently ampli ﬁed ethylene signaling. We identi ﬁed OsERF82, a hitherto unreported ethylene response fac- tor, as the downstream target of OsEIL1/2. OsERF82 transcriptionallyregulates the expression of several genes involved in ROS production,including OsRBOHH and several Class III peroxidase genes.

Apart from OsERF82, it is possible that other target genesregulated by OsEIL1 may also play a small role in the coiling root phenotype of crw1. We found that excessive ROS accumulation in the root tip of crw1 accelerates root cap sloughing through programed cell death, therebyreducing the number of amyloplast and weakening gravity perception.Furthermore, excessive accumulation of ROS disrupted the symme-trical auxin distribution in the root tip by impairing the polar locali-zation of OsPIN2. This is consistent with an earlier ﬁnding that application of exogenous H 2O2inhibits vesicle-mediated traf ﬁcking and polar localization of AtPIN2 in Arabidopsis54. Disrupted polar localization of OsPIN2 and reduced root cap stability together explainthe severe loss of gravitropism in crw1 roots. Thus, limiting ethylene signaling in the nucleus is critical for the normal gravitropic growth of rice roots. Although growing in compacted soil may increase the ethylene level in roots due to restricted gas diffusion 30, we found that gentle mechanical resistance that rice roots typically encounter in water-saturated paddy soil or other soft solid media enhances the degra-dation of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 and thus dampens the excessive ethylenesignaling in crw1 , leading to rescue of the root coiling phenotype. The mechanical resistance required to antagonize ethylene signal-ing ampli ﬁcation is mild (penetration resistance ≥34 Pa), consistent with the soft nature of submerged paddy soil that rice plants areadapted to. This level of mechanical resistance is more than an order of magnitude lower than in water unsaturated and compacted soil used in the study of Pandey et al. 30. Strong mechanical resistance can inhibit root elongation or change the direction of root growth. Forexample, root tips stop growing when encountering three-dimensional impenetrable compactness 30, change direction toavoid a ﬂat obstacle55, or grow in a wavy or circular manner on an impenetrable agar slope56–58. A recent study showed that Arabidopsis roots growing on the agar surface can produce different growth paths in response to subtle changes of mechanical forces59. In the present study, mild mechanical resistance did not affect the normalroot growth of WT but was suf ﬁcient to ensure gravitropic root growth of crw1 and coiling-root accessions, suggesting that mechanical resistance below the level that inhibits root growth canbe sensed by rice roots to help safeguard gravitropism. Such aneffect has not been reported before but is consistent with previousﬁndings that plants can sensitively perceive different strengths of mechanical stimuli from nature and produce rapid thigmonasticresponses or gradual morphogenetic alterations 60,61. We found that the rescue of root gravitropism in crw1 by gentle mechanical resistance requires Ca2+signaling in the root cap. In the absence of OsCRW1/OsEBF1, mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling safeguards the gravitropic growth of crw1 roots by suppressing the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. How enhanced Ca2+signaling in the root cap prevents over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2remains unclear and warrants further investigation. The observationthat knockout of OsEBF2 incrw1 d i dn o ta f f e c tt h er e s c u eo ft h er o o t coiling phenotype by gentle mechanical resistance suggests thatenhanced Ca 2+signaling promotes the degradation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in an OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and OsEBF2-independentmechanism. Mechanosensing-induced Ca 2+signaling may play a parti- cularly important role in keeping ethylene signaling in check under stress conditions, which suppress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF143, or in natural rice accessions with a weak or loss-of-function OsCRW1.On the other hand, although OsCRW1 may be dispensable in uncom-pacted soil, it is needed to restrict excessive ethylene signaling incompacted soil to reduce the inhibition on root growth.Fig. 7 | Mechanosensing induced Ca2+signaling antagonizes ethylene signaling to maintain root gravitropism in crw1. a,bWT and crw1 (both expressing NES- YC3.6 ) were grown in water or different soil for 2 days. aThe NES-YC3.6 ﬂuores- cence in the root caps. bQuanti ﬁcation of NES-YC3.6 ﬂuorescence in the root caps. c–jWT and crw1 expressing various reporters were grown in 0.4% and 0.8% agar with or without 100 μML a C l 3for 2−3d a y s .( c) Cytosolic Ca2+in the root caps detected by NES-YC3.6. dQuanti ﬁcation of NES-YC3.6 intensity. eLugol ’ss t a i n i n g of root caps. fDR5rev::VENUS ﬂuorescence of root tips. gRoot phenotypes. h,iLevel of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in WT and crw1 roots by immunoblot.OsEIL1-Flag and OsEIL2-Flag proteins were detected by Flag antibody (anti-Flag) and the Actin (anti-Actin) was used as a loading control. jTranscriptional level of OsERF82 in roots by Q-PCR.

Fig. 8 | A model of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing inhibiting ethylene signaling to maintain root gravitropism. The presence of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing of root tips maintains root gravitropism in soil. OsCRW1 and the mechanosensing induced Ca2+signaling inhibit the ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82 to control ROS homeostasis in root tips, consequently maintaining the structural stability of root cap and polar localization of OsPIN2, ultimately ensuringgravitropism in rice roots. Some components of this Figure were creased with Adobe Illustrator ( https://helpx.adobe.com/cn/support/illustrator.html ).Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Nature Communications |         (2025) 16:3712 12 Interestingly, we observed that the root coiling phenotype was present in some natural rice accessions when grown in hydroponics,and the phenotype was apparently related to the transcription level ofOsCRW1/OsEBF1 . Some of the coiling-root accessions had a OsCRW1/ OsEBF1 transcript level similar to those in the straight-root accessions, s u g g e s t i n gt h a tv a r i a t i o ni nt h ep r o t e i nl e v e lo ri nt h ec o d i n gs e q u e n c emay also be involved. Growing these rice accessions in soft paddy soilalso restored their gravitropic growth. A lower level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may be advantageous for stress resistance because ofenhanced ethylene signaling, especially when root gravitropic growthcan be safeguarded by mechanosensing. Several stress responsepathways were enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs)between crw1 and WT (Fig. 3b). Among these DEGs, at least 24 genes that were upregulated in crw1 have been previously reported to be involved in the resistance to drought, salinity, cold, or diseases (Sup- plemental Fig. 31). Evolution of land plants is accompanied with expansion of genes involved in hormone signaling and transcriptionfactors 62. Our study shows that mechanosensing induced Ca2+signal- ing plays an unexpected role in balancing the ethylene-auxin signalingpathways for gravitropic growth of plants in soil. Methods Plant materials and growth conditions The japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua11 was used as the wild type (WT)for all experiments. An ethyl methylsulfonate (EMS)-mutagenizedpopulation (M3 generation) was used for root phenotype screening. Transgenic plant materials were generated as described below. Seeds were surface sterilized with 15% NaClO for 30 min, washed withsterilized water, and placed in a 37 °C incubator for 2 days to pro-mote germination. Germinated seeds were transferred to hydro-ponic boxes, soil culture boxes or agar plates to grow depending onthe requirements of different experiments. Experiments were carriedout in a growth room with the following conditions: temperature 28°C ± 0.5 °C, humidity 50% –60%, 12-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 100 mmol of photons m −2s−1. WT and mutant were also grown in two paddy ﬁelds (Nanjing and Sanya) to maturity. Agro- nomic traits, including plant height, tiller number, percentage of ﬁlled grains, 1000-grain weight and grain biomass per plant, were determined at plant maturity. Plasmid construction and plant transformation The CRISPR/Cas9 system63was used to knock out OsCRW1 (Os06g0605900 )a n d OsEBF2 (Os02g0200900 )i nt h eZ h o n g h u a 1 1 background and OsEBF2 ,OsEIL1 (Os03g0324200 ), OsEIL2 (Os07g0685700 ),OsERF2 (Os06g0181700 ),OsERF81 (Os02g0520000 ), and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800 )i nt h e crw1 background. Two 20-bp target sequences were selected from the coding sequence (CDS) ofeach gene and cloned into two single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes of pYLgRNA-OsU6a and pYLgRNA-OsU6b by overlapping PCR, producing proU6a-T1-sgRNA and proU6b-T2-sgRNA fragments, respectively. The two fragments were sequentially cloned into theBsaI site of the pYLCRISPR-Cas9Pubi-H vector to generate the ultimate plasmids. To generate the complementation constructs of proOsCR- W1::OsCRW1 ,proOs06g0604400:: Os06g0604400 and proOs06- g0619600::Os06g0619600 ,w ea m p l i ﬁed the promoter (1739 bp of proOsCRW1 ,3K bo f proOs06g0604400 and 3 Kb of proOs06g0619600 ) and the open reading frame (ORF) of OsCRW1 ,Os06g0604400 and Os06g0619600 from the DNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and ORF were cloned together by overla p p i n gP C Ra n di n t r o d u c e di n t o t h eE c o R I / X b a Is i t eo ft h e pCAMBIAL1301 vector. To generate proOsCRW1::GFP constructs, we ampli ﬁed the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11and the GFP sequence from thepUN1301 vector with addition of the initiation codon. The promoter and GFP sequence were cloned together by overlapping PCR and intro-duced into the HindIII/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. To generatepOsCRW1::GUS constructs, we ampli ﬁed the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced OsCRW1 pro- moter into the HindIII/BamHI site of the p1300 vector. To generate proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag and proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag constructs, we ampli ﬁed the promoter (2588 bp of proOsEIL1 ,2 5 0 0 b po f proOsEIL2 ) and the full-length CDS (without the stop codon) of OsEIL1 andOsEIL2 from the DNA and cDNA of Zhonghua 11. The promoter and CDS were cloned together by overlapping P CR and introduced into the BamHI/ SpeI site of the pTCK303 vector. To generate proUbi::OsEIL1 (OsEIL1-OX) andproUbi::OsEIL2 (OsEIL2-OX) constructs, we ampli ﬁed the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 andOsEIL2 from the cDNA of cv. ZH11 and introduced the CDS segments into the BamHI/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. The plasmids were transformed into the callus of Zhonghua11 or crw1 using Agrobacterium -mediated transformation64. Transformants were veri ﬁed by PCR. All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Zhonghua11 expressing DR5rev::VENUS65,proOsPIN2::OsPIN2- GFP14,o r NES-YC3.665were obtained from previous studies. These genotypes and Zhonghua11 expressing proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag were crossed with crw1 oroscrw1KOlines (maternal) to obtain the reporter or tag lines in the mutant backgroundby PCR. The F3 seeds were used for experiments. Root growth experiments Germinated seeds were placed on a net ﬂoating on deionized water for ten days and then transferred to ½ strength Kimura B nutrient solution66for different durations according to the requirements of experiments. The nutrient solution was changed every three days, andthe pH was maintained at 5.6-5.8. To investigate the effects of nutri-ents, pH, light and dissolved oxygen level on root phenotypes, we grewseedlings of crw1 and WT in hydroponic boxes ﬁlled with deionized water or nutrient solution at the ¼ and ½ strength, different solutionpH (from 4 to 8), light condition (12 h/12 h light/dark or 24 h dark), withor without aeration treatment (dissolved oxygen level 12.45 and5.36 mg/L, respectively). To compare the root phenotypes grown inwater and solid media, we grew germinated seedlings in water (pH =5.6-5.8), water-saturated paddy soil, water-saturated vermiculite or water-saturated peat pellet for 2-10 days. Dissolved oxygen con- centrations in hydroponic solution and soil were measured using adissolved oxygen probe. In some experiments, paddy soil was packedat a normal (1.0 g cm −3)a n dah i g h( 1 . 6 g c m−3) bulk density. The penetration resistance of soil and other solid growth media was mea-sured by using a soil compactness tester. To investigate the effect of mechanical resistance on root pheno- types, we grew seedlings of WT and crw1 in agar-solidi ﬁed medium with 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 or 1.2% (w/ v) agar in square Petri dishes. The top 2-cm agar was removed and the emerged seminal roots (1-2 mm)of WT and crw1 were embedded in the agar and allowed to grow verti- cally for 2 to 3 days. To apply resistance on root tips, we made polystyrene foam spherical pellets (1 mm diameter) with a slit in themiddle, placed root tip into the slit and grew seedlings in deionizedwater for 2-3 days. For chemical treatment, L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn, 10 μM), 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP, 10 μM), 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic Acid (ACC, 1 μM), N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), diphenyleneiodo- nium (DPI, 50 nM), salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) or LaCl 3 (100μM )w e r ea d d e dt od e i o n i z e dw a t e ro ra g a rm e d i u ma c c o r d i n gt o different experiments. Each genotype and treatment had at least 3 bio-logical replicates, 7-12 plants per replicate in short-term hydroponicexperiments, 3-6 plants per replicate in long-term hydroponic experi-ments, 3-4 plants per replicate in petri dish experiments, and 7-12 plants per replicate in soil-vermiculite experiments. MutMap-based gene cloning To clone the causal gene responsible for the coiling-root phenotype of crw1, we backcrossed crw1 to WT (Zhonghua11) to generate F 1Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Nature Communications |         (2025) 16:3712 13 progenies. F 1progenies were selfed to generate F 2progenies. DNA was extracted from 50 F 2plants showing the coiling-root phenotype in water and mixed in equal proportions to generate a pooled genomicDNA of crw1. A pooled genomic DNA of WT was prepared in the same way. Genome sequencing was performed using Illumina Hiseq4000 at 5 0 ×a n d3 0 ×c o v e r a g ef o r crw1 and WT, respectively), generating 150- bp paired-end reads. After removing the adapter sequences and low-quality reads, clean reads were mapped to the reference genomesequence (OsNipponbare-Reference-RGAP7, MSU) using BWAsoftware 67, followed by SNP-calling using GATK software68. Causative v a r i a n tw e r ec a l c u l a t e du s i n gt h eM u t M a pS N P - i n d e xm e t h o d69and candidate SNPs were identi ﬁed. Tissue expression pattern analysis of OsCRW1 Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GUS were grown in water for 3 days before being used for histochemical staining for the GUS activity in roots, and in nutrient solution for different durationsfor GUS staining of leaves and reproductive organs. Roots and othertissues were incubated with a GUS staining solution for 2 h at 37 °C,transferred to 70% ethanol overnight, and then photographed underan ultra-depth stereoscopic microscope (Leica, DVM6a). Transgenicrice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GFP were grown in water for 3 days and roots were cut and were placed on a slide for ﬂuorescence imaging under a macro zoom microscope (Carl Zeiss, MVX10). The GFP ﬂuor- escence was observed at 505-560 nm for emission and 488 nm forexcitation. Subcellular localization of OsCRW1 and OsERF82 To generate constructs of GFP-OsCRW1 orGFP-OsERF82 driven by the CaMV35S promoter ( pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 orpro35S::GFP-OsERF82 ), we ampli ﬁed the full-length CDS of OsCRW1 orOsERF82 from the cDNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced the CDS into the HindIII/EcoRI site of thepSAT6-GFP-C vector. The fragments of pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82 were isolated from the pSAT6-GFP-C vector by PI- PspI endonuclease and introduced into the PI-PspI site of the pRCS2 vector. The plasmids were transformed into rice protoplasts for tran-sient expression 70. Protoplasts were isolated from rice stems and labeled with the nucleus marker 4 ’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for co-localization. The GFP and DAPI ﬂuorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, LSM780) at505-560 nm and 400-470 nm for emission, respectively, and at 488 nmand 360 nm for excitation, respectively. Root cap size observation and amyloplast staining Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut and stained with 0.1%(w/v) basic fuchsin solution for 6 h. Root tips were resin-embedded,sectioned according to a previous method 71, and photographed under a microscope to reveal the root cap size. Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut, stained with 5% (v/v) Lugol ’ss o l u t i o nf o r1m i n u t e , washed with distilled water, and photographed under a microscope forthe observation of the amyloplasts in the root caps. Lugol ’ss t o c k solution was prepared by dissolving 5% (m/v) iodine in 10% (m/v) KIsolution. Fluorescence imaging of OsPIN2 localization, auxin response, cytosolic Ca2+and ROS Plants expressing proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP or the reporter gene for auxin response ( DR5rev::VENUS ) or for cytosolic Ca2+(NES-YC3.6 , dri- ven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter) were grown under different growth conditions or treatments for two to three days. Root tips were cut and immediately observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope. The GFP ﬂuorescence was observed as described above. The VENUS ﬂuorescence was observed at 520-550 nm for emission and 515 nm for excitation. For NES-YC3.6 detection, the measurement ofcpVENUS/ECFP ratio shifts was based on ﬂuorescence resonanceenergy transfer according to a previous method 50. The ECFP ﬂuores- cence was observed at 460-490 nm for emission and 415 nm for exci-tation. For detection of ROS, roots were incubated with 10 μM H 2DCFDA for 10 mins, washed with deionized water, and the ROS ﬂuorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning micro- scope at 505-560 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation,respectively 65. TUNEL assay The TUNEL assay was used to detect the programed cell death of rootcaps. Root tips were sampled and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 mins, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).Root tips were immersed in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for5 mins, washed with PBS, and incubated in the TUNEL detection solu-tion (Beyotime, China) at 37 °C for 1 h. The TUNEL ﬂuorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 515-565 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) The Y2H assay was used to detect the interaction between OsCRW1and OsEIL1 or OsEIL2.The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The full-length CDSofOsEIL1 orOsEIL2 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pGADT7 to generate the pGADT7-OsEIL1 and pGADT7-EIL2 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain (AD). The pGBKT7-OsCRW1 plasmid and pGADT7- OsEIL1 orpGADT7-OsEIL2 plasmid were transformed into the Y2H Gold yeast strain alone or in pairs. pGBKT7-53 together with pGADT7- Twere transformed as a positive control, and pGBKT7-lam together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium(-Trp, -Leu) to an optical density (OD) of 0.8. The serially dilutedyeast solution was inoculated on a double-de ﬁcient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu) and a quadruple-de ﬁcient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu, -His, -Ade, +X- α-gal) for growth. Bimolecular ﬂuorescence complementation The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was fused to the vector of pDONR221- P3P2 , and the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 andOsEIL2 were fused to the vector of pDONR221-P1P4 by gateway cloning, and then were trans- ferred into pBiFCt-2in1-NN vector alone or in pairs by LR clonase to fuse with the N- and C-terminal fragments of yellow ﬂuorescent protein (YFP). The ﬁnal plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tume- faciens strain GV3101. Bacterial cultures of the test combinations and controls were in ﬁltrated into tobacco (Latin name) leaves. Two days after in ﬁltration, the YFP signal was detected under confocal laser microscopy at 520-550 nm and 515 nm for emission and excitation, respectively. Western blot For immunological detection of OsEIL1-Flag, OsEIL2-Flag and OsActinin the roots of WT and crw1, total soluble proteins were extracted from 15-20 seminal roots with 1 ml plant protein extraction buffer. Proteinswere denatured by heating at 95 oC for 10 min in a metal-bath and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, proteins were transferredonto a polyvinylidene di ﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane and immunoblots were probed with the following antibodies in the TBST solution(100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%(v/v) Tween 20, pH=7.4) with 5% non-fat dry milk. A mouse anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and a mouse anti-Actin antibody (Beyotime, AA128,1:5000 dilution) were used as the primary antibodies and HPR-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Beyotime, A0216, 1:5000 dilution)was used as the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence wasArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Nature Communications |         (2025) 16:3712 14 performed using ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturer ’si n s t r u c t i o n s . Yeast one-hybrid The full-length CDS of OsEIL1 ,OsEIL2 orOsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGADT7 vector to express fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain. To detectthe binding of OsEIL1/2 with the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on thepromoter of OsERF82 , we introduced three copies of EBS into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in EBS was designed (EBS mut, CGAGA) and used as a negative control. To detect the binding of OsERF82 with the GCC-box (GCCGCC), G-box(CACGTG) and DRE/CRT (GCCGAC) on the promoter sequence ofOsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes, we introduced three copies of DRE/CRT, GCC box and G box sequence into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in each potential binding site was designed (GCC-box mut, ACCACC; G-box mut, AACTTG; DRE/ CRT mut, GTCGAA) and used as a negative control. pAbAi carrying dif- ferent binding sites were transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain toscreen the proper concentration of aureobasidin A (AbA) for inhibitingtranscriptional self-activation. pGADT7 carrying OsEIL1 orOsEIL2 or OsERF82 ,a n d pAbAi carrying different sequences were co-transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain. The yeast colonies were cultured in Leu-deﬁcient SD liquid medium to OD of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Leu-de ﬁcient SD medium (with or without AbA) for growth. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) The full-length CDS of OsEIL1 ,OsEIL2 orOsERF82 were introduced into the NdeI/XhoI site of the pET29a vector and transformed into Escher- ichia coli BL21 to express OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His or OsERF82-His fusion protein. OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His and OsERF82-His fusion proteins werepuriﬁed from E. coli by nickel af ﬁnity columns. Primers were designed for the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter sequence ofOsERF82 or designed for the ERF-binding sites including the GCC box, the G box and the DRE/CRT sequence on the promoter sequence ofOsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes to synthesize biotin-labeled probes, unlabeled probes, and unlabeled mutation probes. The pro- tein and probe were incubated with EMSA reaction solution (preparedaccording to the manufacturer ’s protocol, Beyotime, China) for 20 min at room temperature, separated on a 5% polyacrylamide native gel at4 °C, and transferred to a nylon membrane. After UV light cross-link-ing, the DNA on the membrane was detected using the Chemilumi-nescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module. Primers used are listed inSupplementary Table 2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)- qPCR assay The ChIP assay was performed using the BeyoChIP ™ChIP Assay Kit (Beyotime, P2080S, China) according to the manufacturer ’si n s t r u c - tions. Plants of pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/ crw1 were grown in water for two day, and 15-20 roots were collected as one biological replicate, with three biological replicates for eachexperiment. Root tissue was cross-linked in 1% (v/v) formaldehydeunder vacuum. Chromatin was extracted from the samples and frag-mented via ultrasound treatment to a size of 200-500 bp, and 2% of theyield was set aside as input template. The OsEIL1-DNA and OsEIL2-DNAcomplex were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (Invi-trogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and protein A/G beads (Beyotime,P2080S, China), or coimmunoprecipitated with IgG (Beyotime, A7028,China) with protein A/G beads. NaCl (0.2 M) was added to the solution of protein-DNA complex and heated at 65 °C for 4 hours to remove the cross-linking between protein and genomic DNA. According to themanufacturer ’s instructions, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloro- form agent for DNA puri ﬁcation (Solarbio, T0250, China). Primers (Supplementary Table 3) were designed near the three EBS sequenceson the OsERF82 promoter. Primers and puri ﬁed DNA were used for ChIP-qPCR. Transactivation activity of OsERF82 The full-length CDS of OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion protein containing the yeast GAL4 transcriptionbinding domain (BD). The pGBKT7-OsERF82 plasmid was transformed into the AH109 yeast strain. pGBKT7 plasmid was transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Drop-out (SD) liquid medium (-Trp) to OD = 0.8. The serially diluted yeastsolution was inoculated on Trp-de ﬁcient SD medium and double- deﬁcient SD medium (-Trp, -His, +X- α-gal) for growth. RNA sequencing RNA sequencing was performed on roots of crw1 and WT grown in water or in a soil-vermiculite mixture for two days. Each group con-tained three replicates with 15-20 plants per replicate. Total RNA wasextracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke). The cDNAlibraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencingplatform at Benagen Technology (Wuhan, China), and 150-bp paired-end reads were generated. For the analysis of gene expression, frag-ments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads and readcounts of each unigene were calculated and normalized based on thenumber of uniquely positioned reads overlapping the exon regions.Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identi ﬁed using R software (v.3.5.1) with the DESeq2 package ( http://bioconductor.org/packages/ release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html ). RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (Bio- Teke, Beijing, China). A HiScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit(Vazyme, Nanjing, China) was used to convert 1 μgo ft o t a lR N At o 20μL cDNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on an RT-PCR detection system (CFX96, Bio-Rad) by using SYBR Green Master Mix(Vazyme, Nanjing, China). OsActin and OsHistone were used as the internal reference genes. The expression levels were calculated using the equation 2 –Δ(ΔCt). Primers are shown in Supplementary Table 3.

Wolffia globosa  implications for bioregenerative life  support systems and space‑based  agriculture Leone Ermes Romano 1*, Jack J. W. A. van Loon 2,3, Luigi Gennaro Izzo 1, Maurizio Iovane 1 &  Giovanna Aronne 1 Understanding the response of plants to varied gravitational conditions is vital for developing  effective food production in space bioregenerative life support systems. This study examines the  impact of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphological responses of Wolffia globosa  (commonly known as “water lentils ” or “duckweed”), assessing its potential as a space crop. Although  an experiment testing the effect of simulated microgravity on Wolffia globosa has been previously  conducted, for the first time, we investigated the effect of multiple gravity levels on the growth  and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa plants. The plant responses to simulated microgravity,  simulated partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity environments were evaluated using random  positioning machines and the large‑diameter centrifuge. As hypothesized, we observed a slight  reaction to different gravitational levels in the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa.  The relative growth rates (RGR) of plants subjected to simulated microgravity and partial gravity  were reduced when compared to those in other gravity levels. The morphological analysis revealed  differences in plant dimensions and frond length‑to‑width ratios under diverse gravity conditions.  Our findings showed that Wolffia globosa is responsive to gravitational changes, with its growth and  morphological adaptations being slightly influenced by varying gravitational environments. As for  other crop species, growth was reduced by the microgravity conditions; however, RGR remained  substantial at 0.33 a day. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a  space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development  of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration  missions. Wolffia globosa, commonly known as “ water lentils ” is a member of the Wolffoideae  subfamily within the Lem - naceae  family, shares similar biological traits with its Lemnoideae  relatives: it is the smallest flowering plant and  shows the fastest growth rate in the plant kingdom and lacks a pseudo root  system1,2. Due to its rapid growth  rate, high protein content, and nutritional value, it has emerged as a promising candidate for sustainable food  production, particularly in agriculturally challenging  regions3–6. This unique plant has recently garnered atten - tion also as a potential bioregenerative life support system (BLSS)  candidate7, offering traits that align with  closed-loop, resource-efficient systems like those adopted for the ESA MELiSSA  Loop8. Nevertheless, as for  other candidate space  crops9,10 to assess the suitability of Wolffia’s  in space cultivation and its ability to recycle  resources efficiently, further laboratory tests investigating growth, nutrition, and genetic responses under extreme  conditions are  fundamental7.OPEN 1Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, Portici, Italy. 2Department Oral and  Maxillofacial Surgery/Pathology, Amsterdam Movement Sciences and Amsterdam Bone Center (ABC), Amsterdam  University Medical Center Location VUmc and Academic Center for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA), Amsterdam,  The Netherlands. 3TEC-MMG-LIS Lab, European Space Agency (ESA) Technology Center (ESTEC), Noordwijk, The  Netherlands. *email: leoneermes.romano@unina.it 2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports  |          (2024) 14:410  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49680-3 www.nature.com/scientificreports/Studying the effects of various stimuli, including different gravity environments, radiations, and their inter - actions, on the growth and development of plants can be challenging and  costly7,11. Space limitations within  onboard test facilities, such as the International Space Station or orbiting vectors, often restrict the number of  replicates, making studies under these conditions even more  demanding12–14. However, cost-effective alternatives  exist in the form of facilities that simulate microgravity and partial gravity levels by continuously altering the  gravitational  vector15–17. These facilities offer higher replicate numbers and serve as robust testbeds for experi - ments involving different gravity  levels18,19. Hypergravity, characterized by gravitational forces greater than Earth’s standard 1 g, is a significant factor in  space exploration, affecting humans, and plant  life20,21. Hypergravity is most prominent during the manuvers of  take-off and landing phases of spacecraft. These brief yet intense episodes of increased gravitational force can  influence various aspects of plant biology and  growth21. Understanding how plants respond to hypergravity is  essential for optimizing their cultivation in space environments and for Earth’s  agriculture22,23. Furthermore, it  provides valuable insights into the mechanisms plants employ to withstand and adapt to extreme gravitational   conditions24,25. Earlier studies under simulated microgravity have shown stable anatomical morphology in Wolffia   plants26,  possible effects of hypergravity on plant growth and reproduction have not yet been investigated. Testing plant  reactions of potential space crops under varying gravity levels, including those experienced during take-off,  landing, or in partial gravities, is reported as  crucial27. Consequently, exploring the adaptability of Wolffia  plants  under different gravitational conditions significantly contributes to our understanding of their  potential7. Recent genome sequencing of Wolffia australiana  has shed light on the gravity-sensing mechanisms and  photomorphogenesis in Wolffia   plants28,29. Due to the loss of gravity sensing genes in the sister species Wolffia  australiana , we also hypothesised for Wolffia globosa a lack of the gravity sensing mechanisms, resulting in a  reduced effect of the different gravity levels on the growth and morphological characteristics. More specifically, we aim to study the effects of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphology  of Wolffia globosa. Leveraging the capabilities of random positioning machines and large-diameter centrifuges,  we simulated microgravity, partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity conditions to comprehensively explore  the impact of varying gravitational environments on this plant species. These machines allow us to generate  and study a range of gravity conditions, thereby elucidating Wolffia globosa’s responses to these diverse gravity  environments and assessing its potential utilisation in space-based food production systems. Materials and methods Plant material and cultivation Plants of Wolffia globosa (9910) have been provided by Prof. Klaus Apperoth from the Department of Plant Physi- ology of the University of Jena, Germany. Upon receive, plant material was surface sterilised with 0.3% bleach/ water solution for 5   min30. After 14 days from disinfection, plants were subcultured for 30 days in N-medium30  under axenic conditions. Therefore, plant material has been transferred under a laminar flow hood in sets of  6-well plates, each filled with 5 ml of N-medium solution and sealed with micropore® tape. Before the experimen- tal run, plants were acclimatised for 24 h at 30 °C. After acclimatisation, an average of 20  ± 4 fronds were trans - ferred in each well of a 6-multiwell plate previously filled with 5 ml of N-medium and 0.8% of Agar to achieve  a semi-solid substrate. The experiment was conducted at 30 ± 0.5 °C average temperature with a photoperiod  of 16/8 h light/dark and a total Photon Flux Density (PFD) of 72.37 ± 10.30 μmol  m−2  s−1 for 168   h2. Carbon  dioxide concentration has been monitored throughout the experiment, resulting in an average concentration  of 303  ± 34 ppm. Hardware description and dimensions Experimental hardware has been developed to hold two multiwell plates in a setup that minimises the gravity gra- dient between the upper and lower multiwell plates. Furthermore, the experimental hardware had to be designed  to fit in most test facilities, setting the lower constraints to an overall dimension of 15*15*15 cm of the smallest  Random Positioning Machine (RPM) available.. Considering these constraints, we designed and developed the  experimental hardware using the free available software SketchUp® (Fig.  1). Due to the constraints described  before, multiwell plates had to be stacked vertically. This setup minimises the distance of the two centres of mass  of both multiwells so that the difference in acceleration can be neglected. The experimental hardware has been  equipped with LED white light (Goming LTD) to ensure proper plant development. Furthermore, 3 cm 5 V fans have been added to the experimental hardware to increase uniformity between the  temperature inside and outside the experimental hardware (Fig.  1). The prototype of the experimental hardware  has been built in plywood. Plywood has been laser cut, and parts have been glued in place with vinyl glue. The  template for laser cutting can be found in supplementary material Appendix A. Nevertheless, the experimental  hardware can be 3D printed in any plastic material, and information for the 3D model can be found on the  directory: GitHub. The inner dimension of each experimental hardware is designed to fit a multiwell plate of standard dimen - sions (12.7  × 8.5 × 2.2 cm). From the multiwell lid to the lighting system, a fixed distance of 2.0 cm has been set  up to guarantee optimal light intensity for plant growth. The experimental hardware’s design and dimensions  are reported below (Fig.  2). Lighting system Light treatment has been achieved utilising two 10 cm 5 V LED stripes illuminating each multiwell plate (Fig.  1).  Via USB connector, the light was connected to a Wi-Fi USB switch that controlled the lighting system and  photoperiod to a 16/8 light/dark cycle. Light emission spectrum has been determined with a spectroradiometer  3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports  |          (2024) 14:410  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49680-3 www.nature.com/scientificreports/(SS-110, Apogee Instruments Inc.) measuring in six different positions within the experimental hardware (N = 6)  in a wavelength range of 340–820 nm. A more detailed composition of the light spectrum is described in Table  1  and Fig.  3. Gravity treatments The study encompassed four different gravity treatments: simulated microgravity, simulated partial gravity  (Moon), and two levels of hypergravity (2 g ad 4g ). In addition, a control group under Earth gravity conditions  was included for comparison (Fig.  4). Simulated microgravity (sim-µg) was achieved using an RPM (Random Positioning Machine, original Dutch  Space Leiden, NL; currently Yuri Space, Meckenbeuren, DE) that allowed the plants to be positioned within  Figure 1.

The RPM was set to a maximum random speed of 60 °/s, minimising residual   acceleration31. RPM was also set to random interval and random direction. Simulated Partial gravity (Moon) (sim-Moon) was simulated using a similar RPM, which was running a dif- ferent program which does not provide a complete random rotation during the experiment but generates vector  orientations and values that are biased such that the averaged resulted gravity vector simulates the Moon. This  proprietary software generated motion can enabled the examination of plant responses to partial gravity ranging  from nearly zero to 0.9 g  levels27. Hypergravity conditions were obtained using the large-diameter centrifuge (LDC)32. Two hypergravity levels  were tested: 2g  and 4 g, corresponding to twice and four times the gravitational force on Earth, respectively. These  conditions allowed investigation of how Wolffia globosa responded to increased gravitational forces. A control group was included, where plants were grown under normal gravity conditions (1g ) in a static  gondola. This control group served as a baseline for comparing the growth and morphology of Wolffia globosa   under different gravity treatments.Table 1.  Light measurements.

Two imaging setups were used: Camera Setup: a Sony Alpha II camera with an 18–70 mm objective was fixed to a camera stand. It captured  top-down images of the multiwell plate placed on a lighting table with a white semi-transparent Polyvinyl chlo - ride panel illuminated by an LED light panel, ensuring uniform lighting conditions. The images thaken with this  setup were used to evaluate growth. Morespecificaly, the relative growth rate (RGR) was calculated by comparing  the area occupied by the plants in pixels at the start of the experiment (t0) and after 168 h (t168). Doubling time  (DT) was determined based on RGR. Stereo Microscope Setup: detailed morphological analysis was performed using a Leica® MZ8 Stereo zoom  Microscope. Images representing replicates for each treatment were captured. Images acquired with the stero - microscope were used to evaluate the morphological traits of Wolffia globosa were compared among gravity  treatments. Morphological traits, such as the dimensions of the long and short axes of the mother fronds, were  measured using Fiji® software. Ratios between the long and short axes of the mother fronds were also calculated  to assess frond roundness. Image analysis has been performed on the images gathered during the experimental run. Two types of analysis  have been conducted: (1) Analysis of the growth parameters (RGR and DT) (2) Analysis of the morphological  differences. RGR has been calculated by comparing the area expressed in pixels occupied by the plant at two-time  intervals (N = 12). Images were analysed using the ilastik® software described by Romano et al.33. We calculated  DT based on RGR as described by  Naumann34. To perform morphological comparison among treatments, one  hundred mother fronds have been randomly selected throughout the different wells of the same multiwell plate  within the same treatment. For coherent results, a phenological standard was determined. We have measured only  mother fronds that had a well-formed daughter frond still attached. Morphological traits have been evaluated  by measuring the long and short side of the mother frond. Long and short side have been always measured as  shown in Fig.  5. Furthermore, we have evaluated the existing ratios with respect to the long side between these  two measurements (N  = 100)26 (Fig.  5). Measurements have been taken utilising Fiji® software. Image analysis data were processed and analysed using SPSS Statistics ver. 21 (IBM Corp.). Differences in  growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa among gravity treatments was assessed by one-way ANOV A  (p < 0.05). Pairwise comparisons were performed using Tukey’s post-hoc test (P  < 0.05) to identify differences  among individual treatments. IUCN policy statement Experimental studies and field research on plants (cultivated or wild), including the collection of plant material,  must comply with relevant institutional, national and international guidelines and legislation. We will strictly  adhere to the IUCN Policy Statement on Research on Endangered Species and the Convention on Trade in  Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Prof. Klaus Apperoth provided specimens in this utilised in this  study from the Department of Plant Physiology of the University of Jena, Germany and are available in the col - lection of the up mentioned university. We confirm compliance with the IUCN policy for plant. Results Relative growth rate (RGR) The analysis of variance (ANOV A) revealed a significant difference (F = 16.47, p  < 0.001) for the RGR among  the different gravity treatments. The Eta-squared and Epsilon-squared effect sizes indicated a large effect of the  treatments on the RGR (Eta-squared = 0.54, Epsilon-squared = 0.51). The post hoc ’Tukey’s test, conducted to  determine the specific differences between the treatments, showed that the simulated microgravity treatment  (sim-µg) (mean difference = 0.33, p < 0.001) had a significantly lower RGR (Fig.  6) compared to the control  treatment (1 g) (mean difference = 0.38 ± 0.02). The simulated Moon partial gravity treatment (sim-Moon g)  also exhibited a lower RGR than the control treatment, but the difference was not statistically significant (mean  difference = 0.36, p = 0.25). In contrast, hypergravity treatments (2 g and 4 g) showed higher RGR compared to the control treatment.  However, there was no significant difference between the control and 2 g hypergravity treatments (mean dif- ference = 0. 38, p = 0.99). The 4 g hypergravity treatment (4 g) showed the highest RGR among all treatments,  Table 2.

The sim-µg treatment exhibited the longest doubling time  of 2.18 days, followed by the sim-Moon g, 1 g, 2 g, and 4 g treatments with doubling times of 1.99, 1.83, 1.82,  and 1.82 days, respectively (Fig.  7). Morphological difference Analysis of the morphological characteristics of Wolffia globosa fronds revealed differences in frond length  among the gravity treatments. Resulting in a variation in the length of both short and long axes. Results of the  ANOV A for the long side length showed a significant difference among gravity treatments (F = 17.34, p  < 0.001).  Results revealed that the fronds in the 1 g treatment exhibited the longest length (mean = 0.76 mm), followed  by the sim-Moon g treatment (mean = 0.76 mm), the sim-µg treatment (mean = 0.75 mm), the 2 g treatment  (mean = 0.73 mm), and the 4 g treatment (mean = 0.71 mm) (Fig.  8). Similarly, for the short side length, a  significant main effect of gravity treatment was found (F  = 5.349, p  < 0.001). Post hoc tests showed that the  fronds in the sim-µg treatment displayed the shortest length (mean  = 0.56 mm), followed by the 4 g treatment  (mean  = 0.57 mm), the sim-Moon g treatment (mean  = 0.57 mm), the 2 g treatment (mean  = 0.58 mm), and the  1 g treatment (mean = 0.59 mm). These results suggest that the gravity environment significantly affects the  MFDF SS LS Figure 5.  Wolffia globosa plant. The dotted line divides the daughter frond (DF) from the mother frond (MF).

While  the results revealed some variations in growth and morphological traits among the different gravity treatments,  these observations present exciting opportunities for further exploration and potential applications. In the realm of plant cultivation for space exploration (on orbital platforms, the Moon, and Mars), a more  profound comprehension of plant reactions to altered gravitational conditions is  essential16. Previous studies  have shown various effects of microgravity on the growth of several plant species, but research on the effects of  partial gravity and hypergravity on plants has been  limited15,18. The aid of facilities such as RPMs and LDC can  be the perfect testing ground before experimenting with true  microgravity18,19 and testing the effect of different  gravity levels on the performances of novel space crop  species7. Plants grown under microgravity conditions manifest a slower growth rate compared to those grown under  Earth’s  gravity35. Results from our investigation show that simulated microgravity and simulated Moon gravity  treatments resulted in slightly lower growth rates than the control treatment (Fig.  5). Although these differ - ences, it is important to note that the relative growth rates observed in these treatments were still substantial,  with the simulated microgravity treatment exhibiting a relative growth rate of 0.33 per day and the simulated  Moon partial gravity treatment exhibiting a relative growth rate of 0.36 per day while it was 0.38 per day in the  1 g control plants. In addition, although reduced by the altered gravity conditions, growth rates of the Wolffia   plants remain higher than those typically observed in other higher plant  species36. Results from past experiments  show the relative growth rate over a span of 40 days of lettuce grown under simulated microgravity, yielding a  rate of 0.08/day37. The effects of altered gravity, especially microgravity (whether real or simulated), on higher plant species have  been the subject of numerous scientific  studies38. Wolffia globosa is the smallest higher plant, and its morphology  is entirely distinct from other higher  plants39. It doesn’t exhibit the typical morphology of roots, stems, and leaves  but only has a frond that cannot be associated with any of the three main  organs39. The results of previous studies  on the effects of altered gravity on plant growth are not directly comparable to this species. Most of the research  conducted focuses on the interactions between microgravity and  roots10–12,14,21. Wolffia globosa is famously  known as a rootless  plant39. To further complicate matters, their rootless nature makes comparison with what has  been studied so far challenging. Additionally, while microgravity has often been reported as a limiting growth  factor for  plants40–42, results from tests performed under hypergravity are disagreeing. Studies on the nucleolar  activity or on the elongation of hypocotyls in both Arabidopsis thaliana  and Cucumis sativus, showed a decrease  in growth  rates43,44. At the same time, other results suggest that hypergravity might not affect  growth45. In our  experiment, the 2g  and 4 g hypergravity treatments manifest an increasing (although not statistically significant)  trend in growth rates compared to the control treatment (Fig.  6). This possible positive response to hypergravity  treatments opens up interesting possibilities for future studies and potential applications in space agriculture but  requires new ad hoc tests, eventually applying higher levels of hypergravity to amplify the phenomenon. In such  a scenario, hypergravity conditions could be leveraged to enhance plant productivity and biomass accumulation  in controlled environments, such as space stations. Considering that morphology plays a crucial role in plant growth, survival, and  productivity46, we investigated  the effect of different gravitational treatments on the shape of Wolffia globosa frond. Moreover, results revealed  significant differences among the treatments for both the long and short sides. Worth mentioning that such an  effect occurred on plants that can be considered genetically identical. The study findings revealed that the fronds of Wolffia globosa  were most extended in the 1 g treatment, both  on the front and back sides. Subsequently, the sim-Moon g, sim-µg, 2 g, and 4 g treatments followed in terms of  frond length. These results suggest that both simulated microgravity and simulated Moon’s partial gravity have  don’t have an impact on frond elongation. Furthermore, when analysing the ratio in relation to the longer side,  significant differences were observed among the gravity treatments, indicating distinct frond shapes. The sim-µg  treatment resulted in the most elongated frond shape, followed by the sim-Moon g, 1 g, 2 g, and 4 g treatments.  These findings provide compelling evidence supporting the significant influence of gravity on the morphological  characteristics of Wolffia globosa fronds. The observed variations in frond length and shape among the treat- ments underscore the role of gravity in shaping plant growth and development. Specifically, the sim-µg treatment  consistently induced the most pronounced changes, suggesting its potential as a key factor in determining frond  morphology. These results contribute to our understanding of how different gravity environments impact the  growth and shape of Wolffia globosa, highlighting the importance of considering gravity conditions in cultivating  and manipulating these plants for various space applications. Understanding the underlying mechanisms driving  these morphological changes could provide valuable insights into the plant’s ability to perceive and respond to  gravitational cues. The adaptability of Wolffia globosa  to altered gravity conditions suggested by our data hints at the potential  use of plants from the genus Wolffia  in space agriculture. These plants, characterised by rapid growth and high  nutrient content, are strong candidates for food production in space, where resource constraints are  critical7,13.  Our findings further appraise the possible use of Wolffia globosa  for space exploration and the establishment of  sustainable agriculture in extraterrestrial environments. The robust growth and adaptability to altered gravity  conditions can be added to the small size, rapid growth rate, and high nutrient content, confirming that this genus  deserves consideration for cultivation in limited space and resource-constrained  environments7. Although Wolffia globosa exhibited a reduced growth rate in our experiment under simulated microgravity,  previous research has seen growth enactment of Wolffia globosa under simulated  microgravity26. As already  mentioned by the authors of the up-mentioned work, the enhanced growth might be linked to better utilisa- tion of dissolved oxygen and organic substances in the growth medium due to the type of cultivation system  they have  employed26. The varying responses observed among different gravity treatments in our experiment  9 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports  |          (2024) 14:410  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49680-3 www.nature.com/scientificreports/could be attributed to the interplay between genetic variability within the Lemnaceae family and the specific  environmental conditions experienced by each individual plant. Notably, the genus Wolffia  comprises numer - ous species with significant genetic diversity. Testing the effects of altered gravity on only one clone of Wolffia  globosa , as done in our experiment, provides a valuable starting point but may not fully capture the entire range  of responses within the genus Wolffia . Further investigations involving multiple Wolffia  species and clones are  warranted to explore the full extent of the species’ reaction to altered gravity and better understand the role of  genetic variability in shaping their growth patterns. The recent sequencing of the genome of Wolffia australiana  has provided valuable insights into the genetic  characteristics of Wolffia   species47. One intriguing finding is the absence of gravity-sensing genes commonly  observed in higher plants. More specifically, new findings have shed light on the missing LAZY proteins in  Wolffia australiana28. This genetic difference suggests that Wolffia  species have evolved alternative mechanisms  to perceive and respond to gravity cues, which may explain the distinct growth patterns exhibited under altered  gravitational conditions. Furthermore, to some degree, the enhanced growth rate seen under the hypergravity  treatment could be attributed to gravity resistance genes such as  PTH248. Our results partially confirmed the  expected limited reaction to gravity also of Wolffia globosa. The adaptability of Wolffia globosa to different gravi- tational conditions supported the hypothesis that the loss of gravity-sensing genes reported in the sister species  Wolffia australiana  might also occur in Wolffia globosa. The slight variations in growth rates and morphological  traits observed among the treatments open up interesting avenues for future research and potential applications  in space agriculture. In addition to its implications for space agriculture, this research also contributes to our understanding of  fundamental plant biology. The findings of our experiment might encourage further investigations to clarify  the evolutionary pathways that shaped the peculiar adaptation to gravity associated to a return to an ancestral  aquatic environment of Wolffia  genus.

This study focuses on anhydrobiosis in tardigrades, which are known for their resilience to severe environmental conditions. Tardigrades utilize several protective mechanisms against desiccation, notably the constitutive expression of cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins in Ramazzottius varieornatus . These proteins share similarities in their amphiphatic alpha helices with late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, but differ  significantly  in their amino acid sequences. In this study, we further explored the functionality of CAHS proteins by analyzing their role in aggregation and tolerance to hyperosmotic stress in mammalian cells. Using live cell imaging, we examined the subcellular localization of several CAHS and LEA proteins in response to hyperosmotic stress. The expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 tended to enhance the resilience to the hyperosmotic conditions. These findings  not only deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of anhydrobiosis but also highlight the potential of CAHS proteins as cryoprotectants.

An organism capable of anhydrobiosis tolerates extreme dehydration (desiccation), dries to equilibrium with moderately to extremely dry air, and then restores its vital functions after rehydration. Anhydrobiosis is observed in both microorganisms and animals, including bacteria, nematodes, seeds, spores, gemma, lichen soredium, egg, shoot fragments, and more ( García, 2011 ; Hibshman et al. , 2020 ; Leprince and Buitink, 2015 ). Desiccation primarily damages proteins, nucleic acids, and membrane lipids, leading to cell death. Therefore, living organisms that exhibit anhydrobiosis have protective mechanisms to mitigate desiccation. Trehalose accumulation (Crowe et al. , 1998 ; Lapinski and Tunnacliffe,  2003 ), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins ( Goyal et al. , 2005 ; Kikawada et al. , 2006 ; MacRae, 2016 ), heat shock proteins (Cornette et al. , 2010 ; King and MacRae, 2015 ), and ROS scavenging ( Gusev et al. , 2010 ; Rizzo et al. , 2010 ) have been proposed as mechanisms of desiccation tolerance ( Janis et al. , 2018 ). Tardigrades, widely used as model organisms for anhydrobiosis research, exhibit extreme tolerance to high and low temperatures, high pressure, and radiation in their anhydrobiotic state ( Rebecchi et al. , 2007 ; Wright, 2001 ). Although several reports have been reported on the defense mechanisms underlying anhydrobiosis in tardigrades, including induction of heat shock proteins and defensive peroxidases (Reuner et al. , 2010 ; Rizzo et al. , 2010 ; Schokraie et al. , 2011 ; Yoshida et al. , 2022 ), cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins, identified  as a family of highly hydrophilic and heat- soluble proteins, have attracted much attention. CAHS proteins are constitutively expressed in Ramazzottius varieornatus , which exhibits strong desiccation tolerance without de novo  gene expression. On the other hand, in another tardigrade, Hypsibius exemplaris , the expression of CAHS proteins is strongly induced under desiccated condition, and these expressions are essential for desiccation tolerance ( Arakawa, 2022 ; Kondo et al. , 2015 , 2019 ; Yoshida et al. , 2017 ). CAHS proteins share some similarities with LEA proteins in terms of bioinformatic Abbreviations CAHS  cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble LEA  late embryogenesis abundant LEAM  late embryogenesis abundant protein mitochondrial MAHS  mitochondrial abundant heat soluble mEGFP  monomeric enhanced green fluorescent  protein psi pound per square inch WST  water-soluble tetrazolium LDH  lactate dehydrogenase Dox doxycycline IC50  half inhibitory concentration EC50  half effective  concentration IDR intrinsically disordered regionpredictions of a strong tendency for amphiphatic α-helix formation, despite their low amino acid sequence similarity to LEA proteins. Recently, several groups, including ours, have reported that the CAHS proteins demonstrate gelation, droplet, or fibrous  structures in vitro  and in cells ( Malki et al. , 2022 ; Tanaka et al. , 2022 ; Veling et al. , 2022 ; Yagi-Utsumi et al. , 2021 ). It has also been shown that the heterologous expression of CAHS proteins suppresses hyperosmotic pressure-induced cell death of budding yeast, bacteria, and Drosphila  S2 cells ( Boothby et al. , 2017 ; Tanaka et al. , 2022 ). However, it remains unclear whether the heterologous expression of CAHS proteins confers hyperosmotic stress tolerance to cultured mammalian cells. In this study, we show the changes in the subcellular localization of R. varieornatus  CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, CAHS12, late embryogenesis abundant protein mitochondrial (LEAM), and mitochondrial abundant heat soluble (MAHS) proteins upon hyperosmotic stress stimulation by live cell imaging in mammalian cultured cells. We also investigated the tolerance to hyperosmotic stress by the expression of CAHS proteins, and found that the expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, or CAHS8 rendered the cells tolerant to the hyperosmotic stress. Methods Plasmid construction All plasmids used in this study are summarized in Table S1, along with Benchling links to the plasmid sequences and maps. Plasmids were constructed by standard molecular biology methods. The cDNAs of R. varieornatus  CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, CAHS12, LEAM, and MAHS were synthesized with codon optimization for the human genome using gBlocks Gene Fragments (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) and inserted into the pCAGGS vector ( Niwa et al. , 1991 ) for transient expression experiments ( Fig. 1 ) and the pT2A vector (pT2Apuro-rtTA2-TRE) for drug-inducible expression experi- ments ( Fig. 2  and 3). Of note, since CAHS proteins are known to be abundantly expressed in tardigrades, we optimized the codon of the CAHS genes in order to express sufficient  amounts of CAHS proteins in HeLa cells. The Tol2-based transposon donor vector (pT2A) and the Tol2 transposase expression vector (pCAGGS-T2TP) were kindly provided by Koichi Kawakami (National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan) ( Kawakami and Noda, 2004 ). The cDNAs of rtTA ( Roney et al. , 2016 ) synthesized by FASMAC, tet-response element, and multiple cloning sites were inserted into a Tol2 donor vector by ligation and Gibson assembly to generate pTol2puro-rtTA2-TRE-MCS. The cDNAs of monomeric enhanced green fluorescent  protein (mEGFP), CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, CAHS8-mEGFP, and CAHS12- mEGFP were subcloned into the pT2Apuro-rtTA2-TRE-MCS vector.T.

HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco ’s Modified Eagle’ s Medium (DMEM) high glucose (#08458-45, Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (#F7524, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37°C in a humidified  atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Establishment of stable cell lines For transposon-mediated gene transfer, HeLa cells were transfected with Tol2 donor vectors and Tol2 transposase- expressing vectors in a 1:1 ratio. Approximately 16 –24 h aftertransfection, the cells were treated with 1.0 μg/mL puromycin (#ant-pr-1, InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) for more than one week to select bulk cell lines. Cells were maintained in the presence of puromycin. In Fig. 2 , the bright fluorescent  cells were sorted into a 96-well plate using a cell sorter (MA900, SONY, Tokyo, Japan), and the single cell clone was used in Fig. 2.

Although t-test was conducted for the data compared with the mEGFP data, the statistical significance  was not observed.mEGFP protein, the CAHS3-mEGFP, the CAHS8-mEGFP, the CAHS12-mEGFP, the LEAM-mEGFP, the MAHS-mEGFP and the mEGFP were transfected into the HeLa cells with 293fectinTM Transfection Reagent (#12347-019, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were loaded onto a microfluidic  plate (M04S-03-5PK, Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer ’s instructions. The microfluidic plates were controlled by a CellASIC ONIX2 Microfluidic  System (CAX2-S0000, Millipore). After 48 h of transfection, the culture medium was replaced with an imaging medium containing FluoroBriteTM DMEM (#A1896701, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 1% GlutaMAXTM Supplement (#35050061, Thermo Fisher Scientific)  and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The imaging medium continuously flowed  at 5 psi ( “psi”  is a unit of pressure) while heating at 37°C by a temperature-controllable manifold (CAX2-MXT20, Millipore). For hyperosmotic shock experiments, 0.5 M sorbitol solution and 0.2 M sodium chloride solution were prepared as follows: 4.5 M sorbitol in DDW and 5 M sodium chloride in DDW were dissolved by the imaging medium, resulting in 0.5 M sorbitol solution and 0.2 M sodium chloride solution, respectively. The transfected cells seeded on microfluidic  plates were time-lapse imaged under the imaging medium condition every 10 sec for 2 min. The imaging medium continuously flowed  at 1 psi while heating at 37°C. Then, 0.5 M sorbitol solution or 0.2 M sodium chloride solution was added, and fluorescence  images were acquired every 10 sec for 5 min. The hyperosmotic medium continuously flowed  at 5 psi while heating at 37°C. After incubation, the hyperosmotic medium was replaced with the imaging medium, and the cells were observed every 10 sec for 10 min. The imaging medium continuously flowed  at 5 psi while heating at 37°C. Cells were imaged with an inverted microscope (IX83, Olympus/ Evident, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an sCMOS camera (ORCA-Fusion BT, Hamamatsu photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan), a spinning disk confocal unit (CSU-W1, Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Musashino, Japan), and diode lasers at a wavelength of 488 nm. An oil immersion objective lens (UPLXAPO100XO, N.A. 1.45, Olympus/Evident) was used. The excitation laser and fluorescence  filter  settings were as follows: excitation laser, 488 nm; dichroic mirror (DM), 405/488/561 nm; and emission filters,  500 –550 nm. During the observation, the cells were incubated with microfluidic  plates at 37°C. The microscope was controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Fluorescence imaging data were analyzed and quantified  in Fiji/ImageJ ( Schindelin et al. , 2012 ). The background was subtracted by a constant value. If salt-and-pepper noise was not negligible, a median filter  with 1-pixel was applied. To compensate for the misregistration caused during time-lapse imaging, the “StackReg function ” was applied with the “Translation” option.Osmotic stress resistance by CAHS1 expression Cell Structure and Function 49: 123–133 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1247/csf.24035 127 Cell Structure and FunctionFluorescence imaging for quantifying expression levels HeLa cells carrying the doxycycline-inducible expression cassette of CAHS1, 3, 8, 12-mEGFP or mEGFP were seeded on a 96-well plate (#167008, Thermo Fisher Scientific).  One day after seeding, the cells were treated with the indicated concentration of doxycycline, and 24 h after doxycycline treatment, the cells were observed with a fluorescence  microscope. The cells were imaged with an inverted microscope (IX81, Olympus/Evident) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Retiga 4000R, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA), an excitation light source (Spectra-X light engine, Lumencor Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA), a laser-based autofocus system (IX2-ZDC, Olympus/ Evident), a controller for filter  wheels and XY stage (MAC5000, Ludl Electronic Products, Hawthorne, NY, USA), and an incubation chamber (STXG-IX3WX, Tokai Hit, Fujinomiya, Japan). An objective lens (UPlanApo 10x, N.A. 0.40, Olympus/Evident) was used. For EGFP imaging, a 475/28 excitation filter,  a 20/80 beamsplitter dichroic mirror (Chroma Technology Corp., Bellows Falls, VT, Japan), and a 542/27 emission filter  (Semrock, IDEX Health & Science, LLC, West Henrietta, NY, USA) were used. During the observation, live cells were incubated in a stage incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. The microscope was controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). The fluorescence  imaging data were analyzed and quantified in Fiji/ImageJ ( Schindelin et al. , 2012 ). The background was subtracted by the rolling ball method. The region of interest (ROI) of each cell was extracted with the “StarDistD2”  function (Probability/Score Threshold: 0.55), and the fluorescence intensity (Mean value) of each ROI was obtained with the “Measure” function. Cell viability assay and cell death assay For the cell viability assay and the cell death assay, a low serum concentration medium (1% FBS), hereinafter referred to as the assay medium, was used to reduce the background absorbance in the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay because serum contains LDH. The assay medium contains 1x DME culture solution (#639-29631, Nitta Gelatin, Yao, Japan), 1% FBS, 26 mM NaHCO3 (#09655-25, Nacalai Tesque), and 1 μg/mL puromycin (if needed). For hyperosmotic stress, a 3.2 M sorbitol solution in the assay medium was prepared by mixing 4.5 M sorbitol in DDW, 5x DME culture solution, 260 mM NaHCO3, 100% FBS, DDW, and 1 mg/mL puromycin. This 3.2 M sorbitol solution in the assay medium was serially diluted with the assay medium to produce the indicated concentration of sorbitol solution. For drug-inducible gene expression, 1 mg/mL doxycycline (#D4116, Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan) was serially diluted with the assay medium to produce the indicated concentration of doxycycline solution in the assay medium. HeLa cells were plated on 96-well plates (7.5 × 102 – 3.0 × 103cells/well) (#167425, Thermo Fisher Scientific),  and cultured in the assay medium for 24 h. To induce gene expression, the cells were treated with doxycycline for 24 h, followed by the treatment with sorbitol solution for 24 h. For the simultaneous cell viability assay and cell death assay ( Fig. 2 ), half of the cell supernatant was used for the water-soluble tetrazolium (WST)-1 assay with a Premix WST-1 Cell Proliferation Assay System (#MK400, TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan) and the other half for the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay with an LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (#MK401, TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer’ s instructions. Both the WST-1 and LDH release assays were evaluated based on absorbance at 450 nm (and 620 nm as a control) using a microplate reader (#51119000, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The absorbance values obtained from the microplate reader were exported and analyzed by Python (ver. 3.7.3). First, the absorbance values were subtracted from the value obtained from the well containing only the assay medium. Second, the subtracted values were normalized by the following equation: Y  =   X−Low /High −Low where Y is the normalized value, X is the experimental data, and High  and Low are the highest and lowest values of the data obtained on the same day, respectively. For the cell viability assay in Fig. 2 , the High and Low values were obtained from the maximum and minimum values on the same day, respectively. In Fig. 3 , where the bulk population cell lines were used, the High and Low values were obtained from the value of the well in the absence of sorbitol and the minimum values on the same day, respectively. For the cell death assay, the High and Low values were taken from the value using Triton X-100 treated cells and the lowest values on the same day, respectively. Of note, the absolute number of cells seeded on the well plate varied between experiments, even though the number of cells was counted and the same number of cells were seeded between experiments. Therefore, the “High”  and “Low”  values were changeable. In addition, the LDH assay requires the supernatant to be taken from each well. These factors and procedures would cause the large variation between experiments. The normalized values were used to generate maps using the seaborn library in Python ( Figs. 2 D, 3B, S1, S2 and S3). The normalized data were fitted  with the following functions using the scipy.optimize. corve_ fit in Python: WST x=max −min∗IC50n/xn+IC50n+min LDH x=max −min∗xn/xn+EC50n+min where WST(x)  and LDH(x)  are the fitted  WST and LDH values, x is the sorbitol concentration, max and min are the maximum and minimum values, n is the Hill coefficient,  and IC50  and EC50  areT.

Structure prediction by AlphaFold2 The predicted structures of CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12 were obtained from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database ( https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/ ). Direct links are as follows: CAHS1 ( https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/J7M799), CAHS3 ( https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/J7M3T1 ), CAHS8 (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/A0A1D1UQN2 ), and CAHS12 (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/A0A1D1VNN8). Results and Discussion Hyperosmotic stress-induced changes in the subcellular localization of CAHS, LEAM, and MAHS proteins in HeLa cells We examined changes in the subcellular localization of anhydrobiosis-related proteins in R. varieornatus  induced by hyperosmotic stress, which is thought to be an early step in anhydrobiosis. Six types of proteins, including CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12, mitochondrial LEA (LEAM), and mitochondrial abundant heat soluble (MAHS), were separately expressed as mEGFP-fused protein in HeLa cells ( Fig. 1 A). We selected CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12 because they reversibly form different  types of aggregates in response to osmotic stimulation ( Tanaka et al. , 2022 ; Yagi-Utsumi et al. , 2021 ), but their roles in osmotic stress resistance have not been investigated except for CAHS3 ( Tanaka et al. , 2022 ). The cells were loaded into a microfluidic  chamber for rapid osmolyte solution perfusion. One day after loading into the microfluidic chamber, the cells were imaged with a spinning disk conformal microscope to visualize the subcellular distribution of these fusion proteins upon hyperosmotic stress such as 0.5 M sorbitol or 0.2 M NaCl ( Fig. 1 B). Of note, NaCl is the principal determinant of tonicity of the extracellular fluid (Burg et al. , 2007 ). However, cell membranes are permeable to Na+, and elevated chloride specifically  increases the expression of α-Na+-K+-ATPase (Capasso et al. , 2003 ). For this reason, poorly permeating organic solutes like sorbitol, mannitol, or raffinose  are often used to produce hypertonicity ( Burg et al. , 2007 ). HeLa cells expressing mEGFP treated with the osmolytes showed increased fluorescence  signal in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and puncta formation in the nucleus ( Fig. 1 C and Movie 1). These changes were reverted to the basal state by osmolyte washout ( Fig. 1 C). Under unstressed conditions, CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS8-mEGFP, and CAHS12-mEGFP were broadly distributed in both the cytosol and nucleus, whereas CAHS3-mEGFP was mainly localized in the cytosol ( Fig. 1 D–G and Movies 2 –5). When exposed to hyperosmotic medium supplemented with 0.5 M sorbitol or 0.2 M NaCl, these CAHS proteins formed different aggregation patterns; CAHS1-mEGFP mainly forms granules andfilamentous  structures and slightly accumulates at the plasma membrane ( Fig. 1 D and Movie 2). CAHS3-mEGFP shows fibrous structures in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 1 E and Movie 3). CAHS8- mEGFP seems to have the same pattern as mEGFP, but it slightly accumulates at the nuclear membrane ( Fig. 1 F and Movie 4). CAHS12-mEGFP appears to undergo decomposition in the nucleus ( Bracha et al. , 2018 ), while it exhibits granules and filamentous  structures ( Fig. 1 G and Movie 5). These results are, for the most part, consistent with previous reports ( Tanaka et al. , 2022 ; Yagi-Utsumi et al. , 2021 ). Interestingly, CAHS proteins appear to behave differently  between 0.5 M sorbitol and 0.2 M NaCl osmotic stress. For example, CAHS1 did not aggregate at the cell membrane under 0.2 M NaCl stress, but showed strong aggregation in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 1 D). CAHS12 also showed strong aggregation at the nuclear membrane and plasma membrane upon 0.5 M sorbitol and 0.2 M NaCl, respectively ( Fig. 1G). Regardless of whether the aggregate forms granules or filaments  during hyperosmotic stress, mEGFP and all CAHS protein condensates show rapid disassembly and restoration of coherent distribution upon the release of stress. It is reasonable to conclude that these rapid aggregation and disassembly processes are attributed to the biophysical properties of both mEGFP and each CAHS protein. Such efficient  reversible phase transitioning mirrors the relatively fast induction and recovery of tardigrade anhydrobiosis. The varying modes of aggregation and localization patterns of different  CAHS paralogs upon hyperosmotic stress suggest that these paralogs serve differentiated  functions rather than for mere redundancy. Emerging tissue-specific  expression patterns of tardigrade anhydrobiosis-related proteins ( Tanaka et al. , 2023 ) could be part of the reasons for such differentiation. It has been reported that two mitochondrial heat-soluble proteins, LEAM and MAHS, in R. varieornatus  improve the hyperosmotic tolerance of human cells, possibly by acting as mitochondrial protectants ( Tanaka et al. , 2015 ). Therefore, we investigated the subcellular localization of LEAM and MAHS in HeLa cells stimulated by hyperosmotic stress. Under unstressed conditions, LEAM-mEGFP and MAHS-mEGFP were localized to the mitochondria, and LEAM-mEGFP was weakly distributed in the cytosol and nucleus ( Fig. 1 H and I). Hyperosmotic stress arrested the random movement of mitochondria, but did not substantially change the subcellular localization of LEAM- mEGFP and MAHS-mEGFP ( Fig. 1 H and I). Removal of osmolytes by replacement with an isosmotic medium resumed the thermal fluctuation  of the mitochondria. Based on the fact that both LEAM and MAHS proteins localize to mitochondria and are highly hydrophilic ( Tanaka et al. , 2015 ), LEAM and MAHS are likely to be localized to the mitochondrial matrix. Taken together, these results suggest that the resistance to hyperosmotic stress by LEAM and MAHS expression is not cell-wide protection as observed for CAHS proteins, so we focused on the CAHS proteins for our subsequent analyses.Osmotic stress resistance by CAHS1 expression Cell Structure and Function 49: 123–133 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1247/csf.24035 129 Cell Structure and FunctionCAHS1 expression renders HeLa cells resistant to hyperosmotic stress Recent studies have elucidated that the CAHS3 protein forms fibrillar  aggregates under hyperosmotic conditions in mammalian cells, thereby enhancing their tolerance to hyperosmotic stress, as observed in Drosophila  S2 cells ( Tanaka et al. , 2022 ). However, the question remained as to whether other CAHS proteins, which exhibit varied aggregation patterns under elevated osmotic pressure, also contribute to augmented resistance to such conditions. To this end, we developed a method for quantitatively assessing osmotic stress resistance using HeLa cells expressing CAHS1 ( Fig. 2 A). We first established a single-cell clone of HeLa cells, expressing CAHS1- mEGFP in a manner dependent on doxycycline treatment. The experimental procedure was as follows: One day after cell seeding, doxycycline was added to induce CAHS1-mEGFP expression for two days, followed by different  concentrations of sorbitol as osmolite. Cell viability and increased cell death were evaluated using the WST-1 and LDH assays, respectively (see Methods for details)( Fig. 2 B). We first confirmed  the increase in CAHS1-mEGFP expression levels when we treated the cells with doxycycline ( Fig. 2 C). Despite performing single-cell cloning, the variation in the expression levels of CAHS1-mEGFP between cells was unexpectedly large. Under this condition, the cells were further exposed to hyperosmotic stress. Cell viability was strongly inhibited even in 0.1 M sorbitol in the absence of doxycycline (Fig. 2 D, left, first row, and Fig. S1). The increase in CAHS1- mEGFP expression attenuated the decrease in cell viability by hyperosmotic stress with sorbitol ( Fig. 2 D, left, and Fig. S1). The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) increased depending on the CAHS1-mEGFP expression level ( Fig. 2 E, left). Parental HeLa cells as a negative control showed no change in cell viability with or without doxycycline treatment ( Fig. 2 E, right). In line with the cell viability assay, the number of hyperosmotic stress-induced cell death was also reduced by the expression of CAHS1-mEGFP ( Fig. 2 D, right, and Fig. S1). The half-maximal effective  concentration (EC50) demonstrated a tendency to elevate with increasing expression of CAHS1-mEGFP ( Fig. 2 F, left). As a negative control, doxycycline treatment did not affect the EC50 values of sorbitol-induced cell death in parental HeLa cells ( Fig. 2 F, right). These results suggest that CAHS1 expression confers resistance to hyperosmotic stress in HeLa cells. CAHS1-mEGFP localizes to aggregates and fibrous structures and even to the plasma membrane at high osmotic pressure ( Fig. 1 D), suggesting that CAHS1 exerts some protective function against osmotic stress at these sites. It should be noted that the time-scales of CAHS1 aggregation (~5 min) is much faster than the inhibition of cell proliferation and cell death (~24 h) in response to hyperosmotic stress. This difference  may explain the non-linear relationship between CAHS1 expression level ( Fig. 2 C) and the effects  of sorbitol oncell viability ( Fig. 2 E) and cell death ( Fig. 2 F). In addition, in this study, the single-cell clone of HeLa cells stably expressing CAHS1-mEGFP indicated lower IC50 values for cell viability and EC50 values for cell death in response to sorbitol stimulation in the absence of doxycycline than parental HeLa cells ( Fig. 2 E and 2F). This may be because the single-cell clones established in this study happen to retain such properties. Further investigation would be needed in future studies to address this concern. Expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, or CAHS8 confers osmotic stress resistance to HeLa cells We next examined the other CAHS proteins for their ability to confer osmotic stress tolerance to HeLa cells. To simplify the experiment, HeLa cell lines were established that express mEGFP, CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, CAHS8-mEGFP, and CAHS12-mEGFP in a doxycycline-dependent manner. Of note, these HeLa cell lines were bulk population cells, but not single- cell clones, because it takes longer time to establish the single- cell clones. First, we quantified  the CAHS expression levels induced by doxycycline treatment in these HeLa cells, and found that doxycycline treatment elevated CAHS expression levels several-fold ( Fig. 3 A). The greater cellular heterogeneity compared to the single-cell cloned CAHS1-mEGFP cell line ( Fig. 2C) may be because these cell lines are bulk population cells that have not been subjected to single-cell cloning. Second, we examined the changes in cell viability in these cell lines upon hyperosmotic stress with sorbitol using the WST-1 assay. The average cell viability of each cell line under conditions without and with doxycycline is shown in the heat map ( Fig. 3 B). Even before doxycycline treatment, cell viability was higher in cells expressing CAHS1-mEGFP and CAHS8-mEGFP, but not CAHS3- mEGFP and CAHS12-mEGFP, than in control mEGFP-expressing cells ( Fig. 3 B, left). This may be because leakage of CAHS1 or CAHS8 proteins prior to doxycycline treatment contributes to tolerance to high osmotic pressure, while the expression levels of CAHS3 and CAHS12 did not reach the critical thresholds. In addition, doxycycline treatment rendered CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, or CAHS8-mEGFP expressing cells more resistant to higher concentrations of sorbitol than control mEGFP-expressing cells ( Fig. 3 B, right). In our hand, CAHS1- mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, CAHS8-mEGFP, or CAHS12-mEGFP expressing cells have rather increased cell viability under low concentrations of sorbitol ( Fig. 3 B, right). At this time, we do not know whether this is a result of variability in our experiments or whether the CAHS proteins potentiate cell viability under low concentrations of sorbitol. To quantitatively evaluate the resistance to hyperosmotic stress, we calculated the ratio of the IC50 value of cell viability against sorbitol after doxycycline treatment to that before doxycycline treatment. The IC50 values of CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, and CAHS8-mEGFP cells increased by 10 –20% in a doxycycline-dependent manner ( Fig. 3C). No increase in the ratio of IC50 values was observed inT. Bino et al. 130 Cell Structure and Function 49: 123–133 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1247/csf.24035 Cell Structure and FunctionmEGFP or CAHS12-mEGFP cells. Although the p-value ( p = 0.058 for CAHS1 compared with mEGFP) indicated that the observed difference  was not statistically significant,  the data suggest a potential trend toward increased resistance to osmotic stress through CAHS1 expression, which may warrant further investigation. The expression level of CAHS12 remained relatively low compared to CAHS3 and CAHS8, which had comparable expression levels before doxycycline treatment ( Fig. 3A). We have previously shown that CAHS1 condensation displays concentration-dependent sigmoidal threshold-like behavior between 0.3 –0.6 mM at neutral pH ( Tanaka et al. , 2022 ; Yagi-Utsumi et al. , 2021 ); therefore, there still remains the possibility that the CAHS12 concentration did not exceed the critical threshold. Nevertheless, from these results, we conclude that overexpression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 moderately confers tolerance to hyperosmotic stress in HeLa cells, and it is regardless of the mode of aggregation, whether granular or fibrous. Finally, we investigated the structure of the CAHS proteins in AlphaFold ( Jumper et al. , 2021 ; Varadi et al. , 2022 ), and found that CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12 all share a single long α-helix and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) at the N- and C-termini ( Fig. 4 ); CAHS3 and CAHS12 have a predicted structure at the N-terminus, but their confidence  is low. Despite the close structural similarity between CAHS proteins, the subcellular localization of these CAHS proteins under high osmotic pressure differed  from each other ( Fig. 1 ). As shown in the previous report, CAHS3 shows a coiled-coil structure and forms a fibrous  structure, thereby stabilizing the cell structure and increasing the resistance to high osmotic pressure ( Tanaka et al. , 2022 ). We have demonstrated that CAHS1 and CAHS8 localize to granules, plasma membrane, and nuclear membrane at high osmotic pressure ( Fig. 1 ), suggesting that CAHS1 and CAHS8 may protect organelles such as plasma membrane and nuclear membrane from hyperosmotic stimuli. These diverse aggregation patterns of CAHS proteins may coordinate anhydrobiosis in tardigrades. Conclusion In this study, we expressed R. varieornatus  CAHS proteins in HeLa cells to investigate their effects  on resistance to hyper- osmotic stress, an early step in anhydrobiosis. All of these proteins demonstrated reversible aggregation upon hyper- osmotic stress in HeLa cells, exhibiting granular and filamentous structures ( Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, we found that expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 conferred resistance to sorbitol- induced hyperosmotic stress in HeLa cells ( Figs. 2  and 3). These results not only provide new insights into the mechanism of desiccation tolerance in R. varieornatus , but also suggest a potential use of these CAHS proteins as cryoprotectants.Fundings This work was financially  supported in part by grants from the MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI (22H02625 and 24H01416) to K.

The NASA GeneLab project has detailed information on radiation exposure using animal models with curated dosimetry information for spaceﬂight experiments. Methods: We analyzed multiple GeneLab omics datasets associated with both ground-based and spaceﬂight radiation studies that included in vivo and in vitro approaches. A range of ions from protons to iron particles with doses from 0.1 to 1.0 Gy for ground studies, as well as samples ﬂown in low Earth orbit (LEO) with total doses of 1.0 mGy to 30 mGy, were utilized. Results: From this analysis, we were able to identify distinct biological signatures associating speciﬁc ions with speciﬁc biological responses due to radiation exposure in space. For example, we discovered changes in mitochondrial function, ribosomal assembly, and immune pathways as a function of dose. Conclusions: We provided a summary of how the GeneLab’s rich database of omics experiments with animal models can be used to generate novel hypotheses to better understand human health risks from GCR exposures.

Introduction Space is a hostile environment, and human space travel will entail e \u000bects at many levels of biological organization leading to related physiological e \u000bects. One of the major environmental factors Cancers 2020 ,12, 381; doi:10.3390 /cancers12020381 www.mdpi.com /journal /cancers Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 2 of 23 in space is radiation. Ionizing radiation in space is composed of a complex mixture of particles including protons from the sun and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) originating from outside the solar system. The GCR is composed of atomic nuclei, including a component of heavy charged and energetic (HZE) particles that are relatively few in number but highly ionizing. A major risk-factor for human spaceﬂight is exposure GCR HZE that can cause DNA damage that is unrepaired or mis-repaired [1]. Current research has shown measurable impact on in several areas a \u000becting human health bone loss [ 2], skeletal muscle atrophy [ 3–5], reproductive hazards in women and men [ 6], cognitive /behavioral changes [ 7], central nervous system (CNS) decrements [ 8,9], and changes in cardiovascular physiology [ 10]. The possibility that space radiation exposure to increase cardiovascular disease risk requires additional validation similar to the ongoing observations of increased cardiac impairment observed in radiotherapy-treated cancer survivors [ 11,12]. Spaceﬂight has also been shown to have an impact on established cancer hallmarks [13], possibly increasing carcinogenic risk [14]. At the molecular level, space radiation from high energy photons and atomic nuclei can cause damage to cellular components, in particular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Damaged DNA, which is inadequately repaired, can led to mutations and chromosomal aberrations that have potential to propagate into RNA, potentially leading to cancer. Simulations using ground-based datasets representative of a combined space radiation and microgravity exposure have demonstrated that oxidative stress processes and mitochondrial dysfunctions are important contributors to biological e\u000bects from spaceﬂight. Simulated microgravity studies have demonstrated an inhibitory e \u000bect on cell cycle and cell proliferation [ 15]. These studies show the value of research centered on understanding the totality of space exposures [ 16]. A multitude of other biological processes that are a \u000bected include increased genomic instability and mutation rates [ 17], immune dysregulation [ 18], and deregulated cellular energetics [ 19]. Conﬂicting results on cellular stemness [ 20] have been reported with e \u000bects such as elongation of telomere and altered telomerase function that require clariﬁcation [21,22]. A substantial amount of work has also been generated in the area of omics. For several decades, omics animal-based studies have been performed to understand the human health risks due to spaceﬂight missions using the International Space Station, the space shuttle, biosatellites, and ground-based experiments. NASA’s growing GeneLab omics database now hosts almost 250 experimental studies on spaceﬂight exposure and analogous ground-based experiments from microbes, plants, animal models, and human /animal-derived cell cultures [ 23]. These data are available as an open-access resource for single- and multi-omic analyses on microarray, RNA-sequencing, bisulﬁte-sequencing, proteomic, metabolomic, and metagenomic datasets. Although these data are targeted to better understand the risks associated with human spaceﬂight, these experiments also demonstrate a unique stress that provides a better understanding of adverse human health e \u000bects due to alterations in cellular behavior owing to factors such as microgravity, altered carbon dioxide levels, psychological stressors, and damaging ionizing radiation exposures from GCR and protons in the Earth’s radiation belts. These datasets, and in particular the in vivo animal models used, present a unique experimental setting to study the cellular and host-level interactions that impact human health. In this study, a meta-analysis of these accumulated transcriptomic datasets in GeneLab relevant to spaceﬂight was undertaken to uncover potential dose-dependent biological responses that will help in understanding the human health risks experienced in the spaceﬂight environment. The studies identiﬁed were from human- and animal-derived tissues or cells exposed to protons and GCR HZEs at doses ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 Gy for ground studies and using samples ﬂown to the International Space Station or shuttle missions with total doses between 1.0 and 30 mGy. Ground experiments are a well-established analog for space ﬂight, but are limited in that they are relatively high dose, high dose rate, and in most cases use single particle species, in contrast to the low dose, low dose rate mixed radiation in space. Further work is needed to elucidate platform-dependent di \u000berences (mixed ﬁelds now being o \u000bered at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory [ 24] are a step in this direction). The datasets were pooled and subjected to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify clusters of gene sets and associated biological processes. The results from this analysis highlight novel cellular Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 3 of 23 responses that may be relevant contributors to the combined e \u000bects of microgravity and space radiation and therefore critical drivers of health risks from space radiation. 2. Results Using primarily in vivo animal models and their associated curated datasets available from the NASA GeneLab’s omics database, an examination of biological responses as a function of radiation dose was made using transcriptional and sequencing data. A total of 30 experimental conditions from 25 GeneLab Data System (GLDS) datasets were collected (Table 1). Multiple datasets were included from human or murine cell cultures or animal tissues from several anatomical sites (adrenal gland, blood, bone marrow, brain, breast, heart, cartilage, skin, eye, hair follicle, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, spleen, or thymus). For the simulated space radiation ground studies (GLDS-73, -80, -109, and -117) information related to energy, linear energy transfer (LET, a measure of energy deposition at the cellular and molecular scale), dose rate, particle charge, and particle mass are available and can be viewed in Table S1. The dose data for all spaceﬂight experiments, with the exception of GLDS-111, were from instruments available on the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. Analysis was completed by subject matter experts from the Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG), Johnson Space Center, NASA. The provenance of data from GLDS-111 (Bion-M1) is detailed in the environmental data section of the GLDS for Bion-M1. The doses and dose rates for ground-based exposures are from the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory with uncertainties that are less than 2% [24]. Table 1.

Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 4 of 23 2.1. Changes in RNA-Speciﬁc Error Rates Comparing Spaceﬂight Versus Ground Control Samples DNA mutations caused by ionizing radiation have been shown to propagate onto RNA during translation, unless they are adequately removed by transcription-coupled repair. Higher doses of radiation exposure to a cell will result in greater accumulated damage, up to a point where the cellular repair mechanisms are overwhelmed. However, lower levels of damage may be replicated into RNA with aberrant e \u000bects on translation and cellular function. Thus, RNA-sequencing data using mice liver samples from two experiments were analyzed to identify potential error rates due to spaceﬂight. Analysis of the GLDS-168 dataset showed no di \u000berence in overall mapping error rates across the entire genome (approximately 0.5%). Further investigation of the mismatches with respect to each chromosome identiﬁed error rates to be near 0.5%; however, there was no di \u000berence between the spaceﬂight and ground control groups (Figure 1A,B). Interestingly, there were di \u000berential error rates across some chromosomes, in particular the sex-associated chromosomes, and error rates for genes associated with mitochondrial DNA were lower than genomic DNA, supporting dynamic DNA damage repair in mitochondria (reviewed in [ 53]). Further analysis revealed increased rates of substitution in speciﬁc base sequences in GLDS-168 samples (Figure 1C) but not in the GLDS-242 dataset (Figure 1D). Speciﬁc base substitutions showed an increase in A >G and C >T substitutions in only GLDS-168 samples. We also observed a signiﬁcant increase in CGT and GTA errors but a decrease in CAC and GTG errors in spaceﬂight animals versus ground controls (all corrected p<0.05; Figure 1E). In contrast the GLDS-242 dataset showed an overall reduction, though non-signiﬁcant, in speciﬁc base errors with a signiﬁcant change in substitutions ( p<0.05, corrected) in spaceﬂight animals compared to ground controls (Figure 1D,F).

Utilizing standa rd bioinformatics  pipelines for RNA-sequencing  and microarray analyses, we obtained expression data for each dataset for use in gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [54]. The results indicated a wide variance of significantly regulated gene sets per  dataset (Figure 2). When considering a false discover y rate (FDR) < 0.05, we observed some datasets  with a low number of significantly regulated ge ne sets, whereas others had a high amount of  significant results for the three GSEA molecular signature database collections (i.e., C5, C2, and C6). Thus, for further analysis, individual gene sets were considered for analysis if they had a FDR < 0.25 in 50% or more of the total datasets examined. Then, using Cytoscape’s enrichment mapper, these  gene sets were grouped into networks and furt her examined using the auto-annotate feature to  cluster similar gene sets on the ba sis of biological similarity, referred to as “annotated gene sets”.

Then, using Cytoscape’s enrichment mapper, these gene sets were grouped into networks and further examined using the auto-annotate feature to cluster similar gene sets on the basis of biological similarity, referred to as “annotated gene sets”.

To compare the number of genes sets with the annotated gene sets, we provided heatmaps and clustering for all the datasets based on the NES for each molecular signature database collection for the analysis with the FDR <0.25 (Figure 4). As expected, the annotated gene sets provided fewer gene sets, enabling a more streamlined analysis downstream.

Transcriptome Evaluation of Biol ogical Functions Impacted by Spacefli ght Exposure in Animal Models    To observe the impact of radiation exposure, tr anscriptional data from experiments spanning 1  to 1000 mGy doses in animal models and cell cultures were examined for alteration in multiple biological pathways. This analysis combined statistically significant biological pathways that resulted  from GSEA analysis for each individual datase t [54]. This included the following three major  molecular signatures database collections: (1) the Gene Ontology (GO; C5) gene sets from biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functi ons; (2) the curated dataset (C2) gene sets from  chemical and genetic perturbations and canoni cal pathways such as the BioCarta, Kyoto  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Path way Interaction Database (PID), and Reactome  pathway databases; and (3) the oncogenic signatures  (C6) gene sets representing major pathways  altered in cancer.  2.3.1.

Transcriptome Evaluation of Biological Functions Impacted by Spaceﬂight Exposure in Animal Models To observe the impact of radiation exposure, transcriptional data from experiments spanning 1 to 1000 mGy doses in animal models and cell cultures were examined for alteration in multiple biological pathways.

Each of these clusters was driven by an overrepresented enrichment of genes related to these pathways. In addition to understanding common biological pathways disrupted by spaceﬂight and ground-based radiation exposure, these results were also used to examine possible dose-dependent trends. Using a k-means clustering of the heatmaps representing each clustering nominal enrichment scores, six major annotated clusters were overwhelmingly represented this data, including (1) mitochondrial pathways, (2) leukocyte and adaptive immune response, (3) wound healing and VEGF pathways, (4) ribosome, (5) lipid pathways, and (6) mitotic nuclear division (Figure 5B). The nominal enrichment score (NES) for these annotated gene sets was plotted from 1mGy to 1000 mGy and ﬁtted using a generalized additive model (GAM) smoothing plot [ 55,56] (Figure 5C). Indeed, there was an observed activation as a function of dose for the mitochondrial pathway, whereas the clusters for the ribosome, lipid pathways, and mitotic nuclear division were generally inactivated. A more Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 8 of 23 uncertain trend was observed for the immune related clusters involving leukocyte and adaptive immune response as well as wound healing and VEGF pathways, demonstrating the complex nature of normal tissue responses to inﬂammation and immune responses.

We also performed an analysis with less stringent statistics, involving a larger set of gene sets,  to observe whether other functions or pathways wo uld appear.

The circles in the plots represent the gene sets and the pink shade around the GAM ﬁts represent the standard error. We also performed an analysis with less stringent statistics, involving a larger set of gene sets, to observe whether other functions or pathways would appear. We performed the same analysis as above but included signiﬁcant GSEA gene sets from the Gene Ontology (C5) database that had an FDR <0.05 in only three of the GeneLab datasets analyzed. Although the FDR was set at a lower threshold, the lower number of required datasets with an FDR <0.05 threshold (Figure 2) would result in more gene sets for the downstream analysis. We saw this as true when observing the number of gene sets (Figure S4). Some k-means clusters were too dense and were split into sub-clusters (Figures S5 and S6). The GAM ﬁts were provided for each cluster and sub-cluster (Figures S7–S9). As expected, this less stringent analysis approach produced less statistically signiﬁcant ﬁts with more noise confounding the data. Interestingly, some new trends appeared that can be related to space radiation-induced health risks, including decreases in muscle-related pathways as a function of increasing dose (Figure S7) and decreases in chromosome pathways with increasing dose (Figure S8). This inclusive analysis strategy demonstrated that analyzing the data in many di \u000berent ways can reveal relevant results when that can easily be missed with only one methodology and overly strict statistical cuto \u000bs. Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 9 of 23 2.3.2. GSEA C2: Curated Dataset Results To expand these results, the canonical pathways (C2) molecular signatures database collection was examined in a similar manner to the gene ontology collection (C5) above. For this analysis, there were 30 total datasets as opposed to 28 for the C5 gene set analysis. We determined 411 signiﬁcantly regulated C2 gene sets using Cytoscape’s enrichment mapper with an FDR \u001425% in 50% of the GeneLab datasets analyzed. Due to the C2 GSEA database containing more gene sets, a larger number of gene sets and auto-annotated terms was expected. From these terms, we observed several key pathways, including mitotic and cell cycle pathways, cancer-related pathways, hypoxia-related pathways, interferon pathways, and pathways related to radiation impact on cells (Figure 6A). Cell cycle pathways [ 57], hypoxia [ 58], interferon dysregulation [ 59], and cancer [ 60–62] have all been observed in previous research studies as dysregulated due to spaceﬂight. We performed a similar analysis with C2 genes sets as we did with the C5 dose-dependent analysis (Figures 5 and 6). Using k-means clustering for heatmaps representing each clustering nominal enrichment scores, 15 major annotated clusters overwhelmingly represented these data, including (1) hypoxia, MYC, and phospholipid pathways; (2) EGF, TNF, and hematopoietic pathways; (3) E2F3, EGFR2, p53, and cell cycle pathways; (4) luminal, miR-21 targets, KRAS, and transformation pathways; (5) RB1, metastasis, mitotic division, and progenitor pathways; (6) hematopoiesis, interferons, and methylation pathways; (7) obesity-, oxidation-, and adipogenic-related pathways; (8) mitochondrial and adipogenesis pathways; (9) complex EIF binding; (10) progesterone; (11) apoptosis and phospholipid pathways; (12) inﬂammatory, invasion, NOTCH, and HNF1a pathways; (13) carcinoma, hypoxia, and IL1a pathways; (14) PKD1, ZMPSTE24, and cardiac dysfunctions; and (15) ICP with H3K27ME3 pathway (Figure 6B,C). Similar to the C5 GO analysis, we observed an increase in mitochondrial pathways as a function of dose. Observing this trend with another pathway database provided additional conﬁdence with these results. A clear decrease with cardiac dysfunctions, PKD1, and ZMPSTE24 was revealed as a function of dose. Interestingly, deﬁciencies or decreases in both PKD1 [63] and ZMPSTE24 [64] expression have been previously shown to cause cardiac dysfunction. These observed biological functions seem to follow a trend that may have be missed by manual analysis. Lastly, less stringent statistics with an FDR <0.05 in only three of the GeneLab Datasets was also analyzed for C2 gene sets (Figures S10–S17). Like the C5 analysis, more gene sets were clustered per group after k-means clustering (Figure S10), leading to three clusters requiring additional k-means sub-clustering analysis (Figures S11–S13). This less statistically stringent analysis on C2 produced additional trends through the GAM ﬁts that were not observed in the more conservative analysis (Figures S14–S17). A clear decrease in TNF pathways was observed with increasing dose (Figure S16), and a novel pathway related to taste transduction was observed as increasing with dose (Figure S17). Interestingly, it has been reported that both olfactory pathways and taste are altered in astronauts, which was previously thought to be due to ﬂuid shifts in the head caused by microgravity conditions [ 65–67]. These data also indicate that space radiation may have some impact on this interesting phenomenon. Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 10 of 23 Cancers  2020 , 12, 381 10 of 24     Figure 6.

GSEA C6: Oncogenic Signatures To observe speciﬁc oncogenic pathways that may change as a function of space radiation exposure, we also included an analysis of the GSEA C6 oncology-speciﬁc collection from the molecular signatures database (Figure 7). From the annotation analysis, we discovered that the main oncogenic pathway Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 11 of 23 impacted by space radiation was KRAS (Figure 7A). KRAS is a known oncogene and has been heavily shown in the literature to be involved with lung cancer induced by space radiation [ 14]. The k-means clustering on the annotated gene sets produced the following ﬁve clusters: (1) KRAS- and LEF1-related pathways; (2) p53-, mTOR-, KRAS-, and CRX-related pathways; (3) PDGF- and TGF \f-related pathways; (4) TBK1, VEGFA, and ERBB2 pathways; and (5) embryonic stem cells (ESC) pathway (Figure 7B). When observing each cluster as a function of dose, there were interesting trends that can shed light on predicting potential oncogenic risk for longer exposure to space radiation. Thus, the following known oncogenes as well as the most regulated C6 oncogenic signatures were speciﬁcally analyzed as a function of dose for all datasets: (1) KRAS, (2) CSR, (3) p53, (4) ESC, (5) TGF \f, (6), VEGFa, and (7) mTOR pathways (Figure 8). These trends as a function of dose across multiple experimental datasets emphasized a need to functionally valid these observations. Cancers  2020 , 12, 381 12 of 24     Figure 7.

As in the previous sections, we also performed analysis with less stringent statistics with a FDR <0.05 in only three of the GeneLab Datasets analyzed for C6 gene sets (Figures S18–S21). Because there are fewer gene sets in the C6 database, this analysis started to yield some of the same results as the analysis with the higher thresholds. The GAM ﬁts for each cluster and sub-cluster produced similar results, with one sub-cluster purely associated with TGF \fdemonstrating the same trend (Figure S21). Interestingly, one cluster associated with TBK1 did not appear in the higher threshold analysis and demonstrated a clear decrease in as a function of dose (Figure S20). Lastly, a major oncogene MYC [ 68,69] did not show up in the higher threshold analysis, whereas in this analysis MYC was clearly being activated with increasing dose (Figure S20), indicating that space radiation exposure would increase the potential for carcinogenesis. 2.4. Common Genes as a Function of Dose and Association with Biological Pathways To look at speciﬁc genes that might be common across all datasets, we performed analysis on the log2 fold-change values for all datasets. Nine genes ( COPB2, UBE2D3, LYPLA2, ARF1, COPB1, CAPNS1, PHB2, DAD1, PRPF8 ) identiﬁed to be common across the spaceﬂight missions (1.0 to 30 mGy) and ground studies (0.1 to 1.0 Gy) were plotted as a function of dose and average log2 fold-change and ﬁt to a complex polynomial model. These genes, which were expressed across the various tissue types, displayed no signiﬁcant expression e \u000bects from spaceﬂight up to 100 mGy. At doses higher than 100 mGy, a slight deviation from baseline expression was observed (Figure 9A). The spaceﬂight studies alone showed slight ﬂuctuations in expression across the identiﬁed gene sets (Figure 9B). A focused analysis of only the muscle tissue datasets identiﬁed a subset of nine di \u000berent genes that were di \u000berentially expressed across the spaceﬂight studies from 0 to 30 mGy (Figure 9C). These genes displayed dose-response trends. The nine common genes associated with all tissue types were associated with pathways centered on Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum transport and post-translational protein modiﬁcations (Figure 9D). In addition, these genes also were predicted to regulated phospholipid activity, immune dysregulation, and embryonic lethality. We observed these pathways to also be involved with our GSEA analysis as a function of dose.

The circles in the plots represent the gene sets  and the pink shade around the GAM fi ts represent the standard error.  As in the previous sections, we also performed analysis with less stringent sta tistics with a FDR <  0.05 in only three of the GeneLab Datasets analyzed for C6 gene sets (Figure S18–S21). Because there  are fewer gene sets in the C6 database, this analysis started to yield some of the same results as the  analysis with the higher thresholds. The GAM fits for each cluster and sub- cluster produced similar  results, with one sub-cluster purely associated with TGF β demonstrating the same trend (Figure S21).   Interestingly, one cluster associated with TBK1 di d not appear in the higher threshold analysis and  demonstra ted a clear decrease in a s a function of dose (Figure S20). Lastly, a major oncogene MYC  [68,69] did not show up in the higher threshold analysis, whereas in this analysis MYC was clearly  being activated with increasing dose (Figure S20), indicating that space radiation exposure would  increase the potential for carcinogenesis.    2.4.

Discussion Here, we presented a novel approach in using publicly available transcriptomic data to determine potential health risks and dysregulation of biological pathways as a function of space radiation exposure. The use of NASA’s GeneLab platform [ 23] allowed us to mine data that might not have otherwise been possible to obtain from individual experimental datasets. The large number of radiation datasets available through this platform allowed the creative combination of di \u000berent datasets from former experiments to generate new hypotheses [71]. Our hypothesis for this work suspected that there was a tissue independent dysregulation as a function of space radiation-absorbed dose that impacted key biological pathways associated with increased health risks such as induction of cancer. Because the GeneLab Data System contains spaceﬂight transcriptomic data from mice and tissues ﬂown in low Earth orbit (LEO) for various time durations, we were able to obtain accumulated space radiation doses from 1 to 30 mGy. To obtain doses that will be more relevant to long-term deep space travel [ 7,14], we combined our analysis with simulated space radiation ground experiments performed in the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory [ 24]. These experiments were performed on both mice and in vitro cell cultures with single ions (protons,56Fe, and26Si) at doses from 100 to 1000 mGy. Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 14 of 23 By combining 25 GeneLab datasets over these doses, this work represents the ﬁrst time a study has provided a comprehensive biological analysis and produced relevant and novel results indicating which relevant biological processes are being regulated as a function of space radiation exposure. These results may be further utilized to generate health risk assessment models and uncover potential targets for mitigation of space radiation e \u000bects via novel therapeutics. We chose to ﬁrst look at the distribution of mapping errors within the RNA-sequencing results from liver samples by examining whether mice exposure to spaceﬂight resulted in detectable changes compared to ground controls. We chose to focus on liver tissue datasets from GeneLab with mice exposed to space radiation because on in the GLDS liver is the organ with the largest number of sequenced tissue thus far from rodent research missions [ 71]. This extremely novel analysis demonstrates how RNA-sequence data can be used to generate useful data other than the standard techniques to generate counts. With a cumulative exposure of 9.20 mGy for GLDS-168 mice, signiﬁcant increases in A >G and C >T base substitutions were detected, as well as changes in CAC, CGT, GTA, or GTG error rates (Figure 1). However, there were no signiﬁcant base-speciﬁc substitutions detected, and CAC, CGT, GTA, or GTG error rates all decreased signiﬁcantly in GLDS-242 where mice received a cumulative dose of 8.03 mGy; however, due to the uncertainty inherent in the ﬂight dosimetry, it was not possible to deﬁnitively determine whether this was the case. A major di \u000berence potentially impacting the observed di \u000berences between GLDS-168 and GLDS-242 was the animal sacriﬁcing time at sample collection, which occurred during spaceﬂight for GLDS-168, but was 2 weeks after returning to Earth for GLDS-242. The recovery time for the mice after 2 weeks back on Earth might possibly allow recovery of the base substitutions and error rates observed during exposure to space radiation. The ability to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in RNA and DNA datasets has been performed previously on the basis of the assumption of a homogeneous genomic sample for example from a tumor [ 70], whereas the sporadic and stochastic nature of HZE exposure is expected to result in random damage throughout the genome [ 72]. Therefore, approaches to map SNVs on the basis of bulk tissue approaches may not be able to account for the stochastic nature of the SNV damage accumulated in a tissue. Our interpretation of these results was that the spaceﬂight animals may have experienced more DNA damage /mutation than ground controls, but in the animals that were returned to Earth, the recovery of the animals allowed for repair to take place. Next, purely on the basis of statistical analysis, we were able to determine key biological functions that were being dysregulated as a function of space radiation. For example, in the C5 Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Figure 5C), ribosomal pathways were observed as decreasing with dose. Ribosomal assembly consisted of a number of ribosomal protein large (rpl) genes that are necessary in the assembly of the eukaryotic ribosome 60S subunit, as well as the ribosomal protein small genes involved 40S and/or 60S subunit assembly. Indeed, ribosome-related genes have been previously reported to be disrupted following exposure to ionizing radiation [73–75]. We observed a clear trend of increased activation of mitochondrial-related pathways in multiple di\u000berent pathway databases, which include both the C5 GO terms (Figure 5C) and C2 curated gene sets (Figure 6C). Mitochondrial gene expression is susceptible to radiation-sensitivity [ 76]. A number of gene sets in these clusters showed dysregulation of the NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDUF) gene family and mitochondria-related function, in agreement with e \u000bects of ionizing radiation on the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in previous studies [ 77–79]. This is especially relevant to human health, as the NASA Twins Study recently revealed mitochondrial stress and increased mitochondrial debris in the blood [21]. A distinct elicitation of inﬂammatory and immune-related cellular functions was also observed in this analysis with alteration in chemokine, cytokine, and interferon expression (Figures 5C and 6C) . Indeed, it has been very well appreciated that ionizing radiation exposure will cause both pro-inﬂammatory and anti-inﬂammatory expression as cellular signals attempt to resolve the unique normal tissue radiation injury that occurs both acutely and longer-term [ 80–82]. This immune signaling dysregulation has also been reported to occur when exposed to space radiation [83,84]. Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 15 of 23 We also explored the potential cancer risk as a function of space radiation. The datasets we utilized for this study were from both in vitro and in vivo samples that did not have any cancer present and were not prone to induction of cancer. From our analysis, we observed several interesting results indicative of increased risk for the induction of cancer. In our analysis on the C6 Oncogenic Signature database, we observed that PDGF and TGF \fwere clustered together, purely on the basis of the statistics, and both were decreasing with increasing dose (cluster 3 in Figure 7C). This observation is closely tied to previously established ﬁndings. In the literature, PDGF and TGF \fare closely related to cancer progression [ 85]. In addition, it has been shown in the clinic that decreases in PDGF and TGF \flevels after radiotherapy for breast cancer can cause echocardiographic alterations a \u000becting cardiovascular morbidity [ 86]. We also observed the highest frequency of the KRAS pathway, a known oncogene [ 87], being impacted as a function dose (Figure 7A). It has been previously described in experiments with single ion species that KRAS can induce lung cancer due to HZE particles [ 14]. Our tissue-independent analysis did not demonstrate any signiﬁcant induction of KRAS with increasing dose (cluster 1 in Figures 7C and 8). This might indicate that either previous experiments done with single ions at higher HZE doses did not capture the dose-dependent trend in tissues, or when considering the full spectrum of ions at lower doses KRAS might not be the key driver in inducing tumor growth. Other oncogenic trends we observed were decreases in CSR, ESC, TGF \f, VEGFA, and mTOR C6 pathway levels as a function of increasing radiation dose (Figures 7 and 8). TGF \f, VEGFa, and mTOR have all previously shown similar trends with increasing dose of simulated space radiation [ 32,88]. The ESC C6 term is refers to di \u000berentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESC) [ 89]. This rather surprising result indicates that increasing dose of space radiation reduces the e \u000eciency of stem cell di \u000berentiation. It has been reported that after ionizing radiation exposure, mitochondria are heavily involved with stem cell development [ 90]. Exploiting these di \u000berent pathway databases (i.e., GO, C2, and C6) provided key insights on how these di \u000berent pathway trends are intertwined. The CSR C6 term refers to “common serum response” (CSR) speciﬁcally related to ﬁbroblast serum [ 91]. Fibroblast serum response refers to factors released in the serum from ﬁbroblasts involved in assisting with wound healing during tumorigenesis [ 91]. We can relate the decrease to the CSR pathways to what we observed in the GO analysis (cluster 3 in Figure 5) related to wound healing and VEGF pathways. We also observed with that wound healing should decrease with increasing doses of space radiation. This decrease can also reduce wound healing due to CSR and has shown that it can lead to tumorigenesis [ 91]. In addition, it has been reported that impairment occurs in space wound healing [92,93], and these data can potentially indicate an increased chance for tumor induction. These observed trends as a function of space radiation exposure revealed unique pathways that seem to be speciﬁcally related to GCR, whereas some pathways from our analysis are known to be universal responses to radiation. The mechanisms of damage are common to highly ionizing radiation regardless of the source [ 94]; what is unique to chronic space radiation exposure is the combination of highly ionizing particles, low dose, and a low dose rate, which may have implications for DNA repair [ 17], mitochondrial pathways [ 16], and lipid pathways [ 42] as just a few examples of what emerged from our analysis. In addition, we found speciﬁc cancer-related pathways that may be unique to space radiation. For example, decreases in TGF \f[32], embryonic stem cells (ESC) [ 95], and VEGFa seem to be unique to space radiation. Spaceﬂight studies have previously revealed a plethora of e\u000bects that radiation can have at individual doses or over a small range of discreet doses. However, the pooling and meta-analysis of these datasets in this study allowed for a unique visualization and comparison over a larger range of radiation doses. This in turn made it possible to identify trends in physiological response from low to high doses and provided insight into the response to accumulating doses that may occur in long duration space missions or over a few days during solar particle events. This technique may also be utilized to determine potential targets for therapeutic intervention. For example, because we report that mitochondrial pathways decrease as a function of space radiation, this argues for additional validation and research on speciﬁc mitochondrial targets for countermeasure development. In addition, from this analysis we can extrapolate to speciﬁc doses that may pose greater Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 16 of 23 health risks. This analysis can only be done by utilizing a large number of datasets that are available from platforms such as NASA’s GeneLab. The resolution obtained from this analysis can easily be lost once we lower the number datasets that will be used. Our analysis has indicated several di \u000berent health risks that may occur with increasing exposure to space radiation. Through an unbiased technique purely driven by statistics and utilizing a large amount of transcriptomic data from NASA’s GeneLab platform, we were able to identify tissue-independent biological pathways that are dysregulated as a function of space radiation dose. We believe this technique can further be used with other datasets and databases to generate more hypotheses that will assist with determining optimal therapeutic countermeasures and targets that can mitigate space radiation response in humans. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Chromosomal and Subsitution Error Rate Mapping Two mouse liver RNA-sequencing datasets (GLDS-168 and GLDS-242) from NASA spaceﬂight experiments were speciﬁcally analyzed for chromosomal or substitution error rates. Compressed fastq ﬁles were cleaned using TRIM galore (v0.6.4, https: //github.com /FelixKrueger /TrimGalore /blob/master / Docs /Trim_Galore_User_Guide.md) to remove adapters and bases falling below a Q20 Phred quality score. Paired reads were aligned to the mouse mm10 reference genome using bowtie2 (v2.3.4.1,) and the output piped through samtools to generate a bam ﬁle. The bam ﬁle had read group information added and was coordinate sorted using Picard tools (v2.21.3,). Mapping metrics were calculated using Picard tools and ﬁnal mismatches (MN ﬂag) extracted with genomic coordinates using Bedtools (v2.26.0, https: //bedtools.readthedocs.io /en/latest /). Data were analyzed in R to determine the frequency of mismatches with respect to chromosome number and plotted. Mapping quality data from Picard tools was analyzed using GraphpadPrism (v7.0, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA). 4.2. Bioinformatics, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and Visulization Using Cytoscape The transcriptome datasets used for this study were from openly available data housed by NASA’s GeneLab platform (genelab.nasa.gov,). There was a total of 25 GeneLab datasets (GLDS) with 30 experimental comparisons from RNA-sequencing or microarray platforms (Table 1). Data pre-processing was performed as previously published to obtain normalized expression values for the majority of the datasets [ 32,33,42]. For GLDS-73, human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were exposed to gamma-rays (1 Gy or 3 Gy), iron (56Fe), or silicon (26Si) particles (0.5 Gy or 1 Gy each). RNA extraction was executed 1 hr after exposure and the transcriptome data were evaluate by microarray technology using the Illumina HumanWG-6 V2 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.) [ 52]. The raw data ﬁles were normalized using the quantile method and then background subtraction was performed using R Package PIMENTo (v1.0). Fold-change values between spaceﬂight /radiation exposure versus ground /control samples were calculated and used for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA,) with three molecular signature dataset collections (C2, C5, and C6 gene sets) [ 54]. These results were imported into Cytoscape (v3.7) for further visualization and interpretation by the Enrichment Map tool [ 96]. Only gene set nodes with a false-detection rate (FDR) <0.25 in at least 50% of the total datasets analyzed were considered for network evaluation. To reduce the complexity of the newly developed networks, we utilized the AutoAnnotate tool (v1.3.2, http: //baderlab.org /Software /AutoAnnotate) in Cytoscape to group-related gene set nodes together. The newly annotated gene sets were then used for further analysis. 4.3. Principal Component Analysis, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, k-Means Clustering, Heatmaps, and Generalized Additive Model Fits The GSEA-produced nominal enrichment scores (NES) were compared using principle component analysis (PCA) plots from the R-program pca3d (v0.10, https: //cran.r-project.org /web/packages /pca3d / Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 17 of 23 pca3d.pdf) [ 97], and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) plots using R-program Rtsne (v0.15, https: //cran.r-project.org /web/packages /Rtsne /Rtsne.pdf). Further characterization was performed by hierarchical k-means clustering on the NES. Heatmaps were generated using the R-program pheatmap (v1.0.12, https: //cran.r-project.org /web/packages /pheatmap /pheatmap.pdf). The auto-annotated gene sets for each k-means cluster were then plotted with the NES versus the dose for associated for each GeneLab dataset (Table 1) with R-program ggplot2 (v3.2.1,). Data points were then ﬁt using a generalized additive model (GAM) [ 55,56] across all dose ranges from 1 to 1000 mGy with R-program mgcv (v1.8-28, https: //cran.r-project.org /web/packages /mgcv /mgcv.pdf) 4.4. Analysis on Common Individual Genes with Fold-Change Values and Fits as a Function of Dose A total of 19 spaceﬂight studies and 3 ground studies were selected from the GeneLab database. Table 1 summarizes the datasets including the tissue, species, the radiation type, and the measured dose. From each study, the fold-change value between irradiated and control for each gene was calculated. For spaceﬂight studies, the log 2fold-change was computed as the ratio of the spaceﬂight measurement to a ground control value. In studies where terrestrial measurements for ground control values were made in both an animal enclosure module (AEM, also referred to as the Rodent Habitat) and a vivarium, the AEM ground control value was used due to the similar module conditions experienced by tissue in the spaceﬂight AEMs. For the terrestrial studies that simulated space radiation, the experimental values were the samples that were irradiated with a speciﬁc ion (i.e.,56Fe,26Si, or proton) compared to the sham unirradiated samples closest to the time of irradiation. Across all of the studies, the most common genes probed were chosen, which produced nine genes present with all the GLDS sets used for this manuscript. A polynomial of degree 2 was ﬁt to the data in the range 1–1000 mGy for all datasets. For ﬁts involving only spaceﬂight samples and only muscle tissues, due to the smaller range of doses up to 30 mGy, data were ﬁt using a polynomial of degree 1. All ﬁts were performed using a chi-square method via CERN’s ROOT toolkit (v.6.18 /02,) [ 98]. The nine genes were entered in ToppCluster [ 99] to determine the predicted pathways and functions these genes will impact. The results from ToppCluster were imported into Cytoscape, where the predicted functions were displayed as a network. 5. Conclusions This work is an example of how GeneLab’s rich database of omics experiments with animal models can be exploited to better understand the e \u000bects of ionizing radiation and the resulting potential risks to humans. This large-scale analysis of multiple transcriptome datasets including RNA-sequencing and microarray datasets provides a valuable examination of dose-dependent perturbations of cellular function across multiple tissue types in animal models. Individually, these experiments were limited by ﬂight duration, resulting in a single accumulated dose from a micture of particles or, in ground-based studies, exposure to a single particle species. When analyzing multiple molecular databases using our approach to many omics datasets, a more comprehensive analysis of signiﬁcantly impacted biological factors can be obtained than was previously possible.

no agreement over the preferred method  of choice. This problem was recently addressed by Roach et  al. (2023 ) who studied three commonly employed methods.  These were two-arm matching, one-arm pointing and one- arm repositioning. Somewhat unexpectedly, each method  produced a significantly different outcome. This led to the  question, do we have more than one position sense? We have maintained a continuing interest in position  sense over the years and, more recently, become aware that  under conditions of weightlessness position sense is dis - turbed (Young et al. 1984 ; Kenyon and Young 1986 ; Weber  et al. 2020 ). It has led us to speculate about possible mecha - nisms responsible for the disturbance (Weber and Proske  2022 ; Proske and Weber 2023 ). In the light of the findings  by Roach et al. ( 2023 ) we have decided to re-measure posi - tion sense during changes in gravity with each of the three  methods and to look for differences in outcomes. Here we  were hoping to obtain new insight into the neural mecha - nisms underlying the generation of position sense. Arguably the most influential study of the effects of  changes in gravity on position sense is that by Lackner and  DiZio ( 1992 ). Position sense was measured, using a two- arm position matching task, during the rises and falls in Introduction The ability to accurately perceive the position of a body part  without looking at it, human position sense, is one of the  proprioceptive senses, “the senses within”. Proprioception  includes the senses of position, movement, force, heavi - ness, and balance (Proske and Gandevia 2012 ). Arguably,  the sense of position is the most important of these, since it  is believed to contribute to our self-awareness (Cole 1995 )  and it is an important contributor to the control of reach - ing movements (Desmurget et al. 1995 ; Sarlegna and Sains - burg, 2009 ).

This was tested, employing three meth - ods of measurement: two-arm matching, one-arm pointing and one-arm repositioning, carried out during parabolic flight.  In hypergravity (1.8G), position sense errors in a matching task increased significantly from the value during horizontal  flight (1G) of + 2.5° (± 3.8° SD), to + 3.5° (± 3.3°). For pointing, errors increased significantly from + 9.1° (± 4.4°) to  + 11.2° (± 4.4°). In microgravity (0G), matching errors fell significantly to + 0.35° (± 3.5°), while in pointing the fall was  not significant. For repositioning, there were no significant changes in errors in either hypergravity or microgravity. It is  proposed that the errors in matching and pointing are a consequence of the force of gravity acting at the elbow joint to  alter the position signal coming from muscle and joint receptors. For repositioning, memory of the test angle was stored  centrally, to be reproduced independently of any changes in gravity.

However, rather than study - ing position sense directly, the authors made observations on  the illusory changes in perceived limb position in response  to muscle vibration (Goodwin et al. 1972 ). The method has  the advantage of producing large changes in position sense  for which the influence of gravity can be readily studied.  Other reports on position sense in microgravity were those  of Bock ( 1994 ) and Bringoux et al. ( 2012 ). The explanation preferred by Lackner & DiZio for their  findings was that spindle output per unit stretch of arm  muscles was influenced by G-level. Spindle rates can be  altered by means of muscle length changes and by fusimo - tor activity. The authors proposed that gravity-dependent  vestibular stimulation led to changes in fusimotor activation  of spindles in forearm muscles and this altered the vibra - tion responses. Our own hypothesis for the gravity effects  was based on the findings of Bringoux et al. ( 2012 ). They  showed that errors were made in a reaching task, carried  out during parabolic flight, where participants overshot the  target in hypergravity and undershot it in microgravity. Add - ing gravity-like torque, by means of elastic straps stretched  across the arm before and during the movement recovered  participants’ performance in microgravity to resemble that  in normal gravity. The authors postulated that in micrograv - ity the increased joint torque generated by the elastic straps  enhanced arm position sense. We have considered the possibility that the normal posi - tion signal, especially near the flexion or extension limits of  a joint’s working range, was likely to include inputs from  both spindles and joint receptors (Proske 2023 ). In hyper - gravity, torque levels at the joint would be expected to  increase, to raise the joint receptor component of the posi - tion signal and therefore lead to increases in position sense  values above those for 1G levels. Similarly, a fall in joint  torque would lower the joint receptor component and there - fore reduce position sense values below 1G values. With this mechanism in mind, we compared position sense values  using the three methods and asked the question, were all  three similarly affected by the changes in gravity? In the present study we have chosen to measure position  sense directly, rather than as a vibration illusion. In view of  the findings of Roach et al. ( 2023 ), we have considered the  possibility of the existence of more than one position sense  (Weber and Proske 2022 ). It has led us to re-examine the  question of the effects of weightlessness on position sense,  more broadly. Participants were asked to measure position  sense with each of the three methods, during periods of  high and low gravity generated during a series of parabolic  flights. The aim was to try to confirm, during periods of high  and low gravity, the disturbance of position sense, measured  with each method. Methods Sample 12 adult participants (1female, 11male) 26–53 years old  (M = 37.9 years, ± 8.2 SD), took part in the present study.  Participation was voluntary. One of the participants had  previously taken part in similar parabolic flight campaigns.  None of the participants performed regular fitness exercises  with their arms or reported current or past arm injuries. All  participants underwent a medical assessment before taking  part in the flight campaign. In addition, their health status  was checked on the first day of the week of the flight cam - paign by an aviation physician. Participants were informed  in advance about the experimental tasks and procedures  and all provided written, informed consent. The experimen - tal protocol was approved by a French ethics committee  (“Comité de protection des personnes Sud-Méditerranée I”;  ID RCB number: 2023-A01115-40). Ethical aspects of the  project conformed with the Declaration of Helsinki. Apparatus Experimental setup The experimental setup consisted of an equipment rack  fixed to a base plate and two seats also on base plates, all  bolted firmly to the floor of the aircraft. In the equipment  rack, all necessary hardware components (personal com - puter, motor controllers, electronical components etc.) were  firmly locked in place. Two paddle setups, on each side of  the equipment rack, were installed, facing each other, so that  two participants could perform the experiment at the same  time (see Fig. 1). Each setup’s height could be adjusted   Fig. 1  Experimental Setup: Two participants sat facing one another in  the set-up. Both gave written consent to publication  1 3127  Page 2 of 12 Experimental Brain Research (2025) 243:127individually to suit the participant. In front of each partici - pant were two paddles, which could be moved freely in the  sagittal plane over a range of 90° from the horizontal (0°)  to the vertical position (90°). Mechanical stops prevented  movements beyond this range. Both paddles could be auto - matically moved to predefined angles by integrated motors.  For one of the two paddles and its motor, an electromagnetic  clutch was incorporated which, when released, allowed  the paddle to move freely, without any frictional or inertia  effects from the motor. Indicated angles were recorded by  potentiometers with an angular resolution of ± 0.3°. Selected  positions of both paddles could be locked in place by motor  brakes. At one end of each paddle was a soft elbow support  (with a Velcro strap to hold the elbow in position) and at  the other end there was a padded hand rest with a handle.  The elbow rest was positioned so that the elbow pivot point  and the paddle’s axis of rotation were aligned. The distance  between elbow rest and hand rest as well as the distance  between handle and paddle could be individually adjusted. To ensure body stabilization during microgravity, the  participants’ feet were strapped to the base plate of the  experimental setup. To stabilize participants during the  hypergravity phases, a seat support was placed behind the  participant which they could lean against or sit on (see  Fig. 1). All structures were padded with foam for protection.  At one side of the rack, the experimenter’s working area  was set up on the floor, equipped with a laptop for monitor - ing and controlling the experimental procedures. Experimental software The different gravitational phases during the parabolae  (1.8 g, 0 g, 1.8 g, 1 g) were detected using an acceleration  sensor. For the first hypergravity phase, measurements were  initiated after gravity values reached above 1.5 g, the micro - gravity phase after they fell below 0.6 g, and the second  hypergravity phase when the g-value was back above 1.3 g.  Finally, normal gravity was triggered when gravity values  had returned to below 1.15 g (Fig. 2). Each measurement  phase was initiated only when gravity changes persisted for  long enough. When conditions were suitable, the measure - ment proceeded, with the participant receiving their instruc - tions via headphones. The control of the paddles as well as  the evaluation of the accelerometer data was implemented  in Matlab/ Simulink. The control software was executed on  a real-time Linux platform at 1 kHz sampling rate. Timing  of the pre-recorded instructions and paddle positions in a  particular task were controlled by a JA V A program. The log - ging was implemented in C ++ enabling the automated iden - tification of each parabola phase in separate files.The experiments Participants completed three different experiments: (1) a  two-arm matching task, (2) a one-arm a pointing task, and  (3) a one-arm repositioning task. For all three experiments a  test angle of 60° was used, representing approximately the  middle of the forearm’s working range. Two-arm matching During this task, participants were blindfolded. The experi - ment started with both forearms in a flexed posture (i.e.  forearm at 90° to the horizontal). To begin with, forearm  muscles had to be conditioned, to account for spindle thixo - tropic properties. With both paddles locked in position,  the participant carried out isometric contractions of elbow  flexors of both arms, followed by isometric contractions of  elbow extensors. The contractions were approximately 20%  of maximum, 0.5s in duration. To do that, participants were  asked to pull both arms towards their body (“pull”), or to  push them away, (“push”). When participants had relaxed,  the experimental trials were started. One paddle was  unlocked and the passive forearm of the reference arm was  automatically moved in the direction of extension to the test  angle and held in that position. Then the clutch of the other  paddle opened and they were asked to bring the indicator  arm into a matching position. Participants were told to move  the indicator to a position where the two arms felt aligned. One-arm pointing In the pointing experiment participants wore an eye patch  over the eye closest to the reference arm which was also hid - den behind a cloth. It meant that during pointing neither the  reference arm nor its shoulder was visible to the participant.  Before the reference arm was moved to the test angle, it  was co-conditioned at 90°, as above. Participants carried out  contractions of flexors followed by contractions of exten - sors and, once they had relaxed, the arm was automatically  moved to a chosen test angle. The clutch of the other paddle  opened and participants were asked to move this pointer  paddle to a position that they felt corresponded to the posi - tion of the hidden reference arm. To do that, participants  grasped the pointer paddle by its handle and moved it into  position. One-arm repositioning Here, participants were also blindfolded. The participant co- conditioned both antagonists of one arm with isometric con - tractions. Once they had relaxed, the arm was automatically  moved to a chosen test angle. It was held at that angle for  1 3Page 3 of 12 127 Experimental Brain Research (2025) 243:127 Fig. 2  Examples of flight recordings.

In addition, the entire procedure for the  three experiments was rehearsed on the apparatus. The parabolic flights were organized and carried out by  NOVESPACE at Mérignac International Airport in Bor - deaux. The experimental crew and participants were briefed  by NOVESPACE before flight regarding general procedures  and safety regulations during the flight. Two pairs of partici - pants took part on each of the three subsequent flight days. On the morning of their flight day, participants completed  the pre-flight session in the aircraft while on ground. Dur - ing this session, participants were again reminded about the  experimental task, setup and procedure. Then, the control  experiment was carried out as described above. Immediately pre-flight, all participants (experimenter and  participants) received a standard dose of Scopolamine (0.7- 1.0 ml for first flyers, 0.5 ml for experienced flyers). Scopol - amine is the standard medication used to minimise the risk  of motion sickness during parabolic flights. Side effects can  be blurred vision, drowsiness, dilated pupils and dry mouth.  No participants in our study exhibited counter-reactions to  the drug and the subsequent experimental trials proceeded  uneventfully. However, one participant experienced motion  sickness during the repositioning experiment, despite hav - ing taken the drug and had to abandon the experiment. After  medication, participants boarded the flight, an Airbus A310. A complete flight took about 3.5 h and 31 parabolae were  flown during this period. The first parabola (#0) was used  for familiarization, i.e. participants simply lay down on  the floor of the aircraft during the parabola. Then, the first  pair of participants took up their positions at the setup; they  were secured with a harness, positioned their feet in the foot  straps and arms in the lever setup, put on the headphones  and, depending on the task, the eye patch/blindfold was put  in place. Meanwhile, the second pair of participants and the  experimenter were sitting on the floor at the side of the rack,  secured with belts to the floor of the aircraft. The typical time sequence for each parabola was ~ 20 s  hypergravity, ~ 22 s microgravity, again ~ 20 s hypergravity,  and finally, back to normal gravity. The transitions between  the various gravity phases were monitored by the acceler - ometer. When the required g-value had been reached, the  experiment was started and participants were instructed via  the headphones. After a break (~ 1 min 45 s), the next parab - ola was begun (see Fig. 2). After each participant had completed five parabolae there  was a break of 5 min, followed by a longer break of 8 min  after 15 parabolae. During the longer break, the next two  participants took up their position at the setup, the hand  rests were adjusted and the same protocol was carried out,  as before.2s while the participant remembered its position. Then the  arm was returned to its starting position before being condi - tioned a second time. The clutch of the paddle was released  and the participant was then asked to move their arm to the  remembered position. The pre-recorded instructions in all three conditions were  given via headphones. The contractions in the 90° position  were announced with “pull-push”, followed up by presenta - tion of the test angle with the announcement, “test angle”.  As soon as the clutch on the indicator side opened, the com - mand “match” was given. Now the participant could set the  desired matching angle; they had 6 s to do so and for the last  three seconds there was a countdown “3-2-1”. At the end  of the countdown, the angle adopted by the indicator arm  was recorded. This procedure was necessary given the time  limitations of the gravitational episodes. Experimental design There were two experimental sessions: a pre-flight session  and a flight session. During flight, participants performed  experimental trials during each gravity phase of a parabola:  (1) hypergravity (1.8 g), (2) microgravity (0 g), (3) hyper - gravity (1.8 g) and (4) horizontal flight (1 g). The pre-flight  data were used to provide a baseline for comparison with  results acquired during the flight. During the flight, each participant performed the experi - mental tasks over fifteen parabolae. An experimental block  during a parabola included each of the four gravity phases  (1.8 g, 0 g, 1.8 g, 1 g). This made for a total of 60 trials over  the 15 parabolae. Each of the three experiments was per - formed during five consecutive experimental blocks, while  their order was counterbalanced across participants. The  same procedure was adopted in the preflight session, except  that the pauses of about 1 min 45 s between each parab - ola in flight were shortened to 40 s. Moreover, participants  only completed two experimental blocks, i.e. two simulated  parabolae for each condition; 6 blocks x 4 phases = 24 trials.  The rest period between the three experiments was 100 s. Since it is known that there are differences in proprio - ception between the two arms (Goble et al. 2006 ), partici - pants were assigned to the two sides of the experimental  rack so that 6 participants had their dominant arm as the  reference, while the other 6 had their non-dominant arm as  the reference. Procedural arrangements All participants were informed about the background and  procedure of the study and about the parabolic flights, in an  online briefing one month before the experiment. 2–3 weeks  before the campaign, all participants were also invited to the  1 3Page 5 of 12 127 Experimental Brain Research (2025) 243:127Results Pre-flight As a first step, the data acquired on the ground (pre - flight session) were analysed. Since errors in the differ - ent experiments were normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk  test; W = 0.89), a rmANOV A could be performed, compar - ing the averaged position errors in the three experiments.  A significant overall main effect was found in rmANOV A  (F (2,22) = 10.99; p <.001; η2 = 0.50). Post-comparisons  indicated that errors were largest for pointing ( M = 5.95°;  SD = 5.64°), which were significantly larger than for match - ing ( M = 0.97°; SD = 4.0°; p <.0025, two-tailed testing, 2tt)  and repositioning ( M = -0.19°; SD = 3.96°; p <.007; 2tt; see  Table 1). In-flight, single participant Examples of position sense measurements for one partici - pant are shown in Fig. 3. During two-arm matching at 1G,  (NG), the mean error for the 5 episodes of horizontal flight  was 4.4°. That is, the participant matched the position of  their reference arm by placing the indicator 4.4° further  in the direction of extension. For the first period of hyper - gravity (HG 1) the mean error into extension increased to  4.8°. It then fell to 2.5° during the episode of microgravity  (MG), to reach a value of 7.7° during the second period of  hypergravity (HG 2). In other words, in relation to errors at  1G, there was an increase in hypergravity and a decrease in  microgravity. For one-arm pointing, the pattern of errors was similar.  The NG value for the mean of the 5 trials was 7.1° in the  direction of extension. This increased to 10.9° during HG  1 and to 10.6° during HG 2. In microgravity it fell to 5.7°.  A feature of the errors in pointing was that while increases  in errors in HG and falls in MG were smaller relative to the  NG value, compared with two-arm matching, all pointing  errors lay further in the direction of extension of the arm,  including the value for NG. Finally, for repositioning the  errors were all smaller than for matching and pointing. The  NG value was 0.5°. This fell to -1.8° during HG 1, that is,  the mean error was now 1.8° in the direction of flexion. The  error was again − 1.8° for HG 2 and − 0.6° for MG. In-flight, group data Group errors for the 12 participants are shown in Fig. 4. It  can be seen that errors in repositioning were much smaller  than in matching and pointing. For pointing and matching  the trend of an increase in errors during hypergravity and a  decrease during microgravity, relative to the normal gravity Data analysis For two-arm matching, the angles of the reference and indi - cator arms were recorded. The matching error was calcu - lated as the difference between the two angles (reference  angle - indicator angle), where positive values corresponded  to errors in the direction of arm extension and negative val - ues in the direction of flexion. The same was done for one- arm pointing; the angle of the hidden reference arm was  compared with the pointed value. The error for one-arm  repositioning was calculated as the difference between the  remembered angle and the repositioned angle. For the fol - lowing analyses, the recorded error measures were averaged  across all trials for one experiment (i.e. 2 blocks during pre - flight, 5 blocks for each gravitational phase during flight). The error measures were analysed with repeated measures  ANOV A (rmANOV A) comparing the three experiments  (matching vs. pointing vs. repositioning) in the preflight  session and a 3 (experiment: matching vs. pointing vs. repo - sitioning) x 3 (gravity: HG, MG, NG) rmANOV A for the  flight session. Sphericity was checked using Mauchly’s test.  Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were made if non-sphe - ricity was indicated by this test. Alpha levels of post-hoc  comparisons were Bonferroni-Holm corrected. In case of  non-normality of the error distributions, non-parametric  Friedman tests and subsequent Wilcoxon signed-rank tests  with Bonferroni-Holm alpha corrections were performed.  For all comparisons one-tailed tests (1tt) were performed  to verify directional hypotheses, otherwise two-tailed tests  (2tt) were chosen. Data for one participant during the repositioning experi - ment is missing, since they had to abandon the experiment.  As the result of a problem with data recording during the  pre-flight session, values for two participants from one of  the two experimental blocks in this session are missing.

Further analysis used only the in-flight values for normal  gravity (NG). The reason was that during flight there were  small fluctuations in g-values (see Fig. 2). For this reason,  and in order to take into account possible effects of Scopol - amine administration, comparisons were limited to within  flight. Next, the normal gravity episodes (NG) were compared  with the microgravity (MG) and hypergravity (HG) epi - sodes, (see Table 1; Fig. 4). For matching , two Wilcoxon tests were performed, indi - cating that error values were significantly lower (i.e. less  forearm extension) for MG ( M = 0.35°; SD = 3.50°) com - pared to NG ( M = 2.48°; SD = 3.80°; p =.0121, one-tailed  testing, 1tt). On the other hand, for HG, error values were  significantly higher ( M = 3.48°; SD = 3.29°; p =.0497, 1tt)  compared to the NG baseline. Wilcoxon comparisons for pointing  showed a trend for  error values to be lower in MG ( M = 7.28°; SD = 5.63°) com - pared to the NG values ( M = 9.09°; SD = 4.42°), although  the required level of significance was not reached ( p =.0583, value is clearly apparent. Values for matching were smaller  than for pointing. In-flight errors were not normally distributed (Shapiro- Wilk test; W  = 0.75; p =.00191), making it necessary to  process the data with non-parametric statistics. First, it was  tested whether there was an overall effect of experiments  on error values during the normal gravity episode. Fried - man indicated significant differences ( χ2(2) = 17.6; p <.001).  Again, errors in pointing (M = 9.09°; SD = 4.42°) were  significantly larger compared to repositioning ( M = 0.01°;  SD = 3.94°, p =.00669, 2tt) and matching ( M = 2.48°;  SD = 3.8°; p =.00665, 2tt, see Table 1) as indicated by Wil - coxon tests. Next, the errors in the two hypergravity episodes HG1  and HG2 were compared. For all three experiments, no sig - nificant difference was found in Wilcoxon tests ( Z = 0.39  − 0.71, 2tt). Therefore, errors in HG1 and HG2 were com - bined and averaged for the subsequent analysis and labelled  as hypergravity condition (HG). Additionally, the preflight  error values were compared to the normal gravity flight epi - sodes (NG), but no significant difference was found when  Fig. 3  Data from a single participant. a: Two-arm matching, b: One- arm pointing, c: One-arm repositioning.

The convention was used that positive values were assigned to errors in the  direction of elbow extension, negative values to errors in the direction  of flexion  1 3Page 7 of 12 127 Experimental Brain Research (2025) 243:127repositioning, the data suggested that position sense values  were unresponsive to changes in gravity. Given these differ - ences in outcomes, the current observations emphasize the  importance of declaring the method used whenever position  sense is measured, both at ground level and under condi - tions of weightlessness. Our observations suggest that of the  three methods used in the present study, with the method of  repositioning, it is not possible to reveal any disturbance of  position sense by gravity and that if gravity effects were to  be studied further, the preferred methods to use would have  to be matching or pointing. In Roach et al. ( 2023 ), before each measurement, elbow  muscles were conditioned in such a way that it brought out a  thixotropic pattern in the distribution of the position errors.  Since muscle spindles are the only known sensory recep - tors to exhibit thixotropy (Proske et al. 1993 ), such patterns  were interpreted as evidence for spindles being involved in  generation of the position signals. There was evidence of  spindle participation in position sense measured with two- arm matching and one-arm pointing, while for repositioning  the evidence was weak. Such an outcome reflected a similar  pattern to that seen with gravity effects in the present study.  It tempted us to say that when spindle participation in a  measurement could be demonstrated, this made it likely that  gravity effects could be revealed as well. It was as though  in a measurement of position sense the gravity effects were 1tt). Again, error values for HG were significantly higher  (M = 11.21°; SD = 4.38°) compared to NG ( p <.00222, 1tt). For the repositioning task , the two Wilcoxon tests com - paring NG ( M = 0.01°; SD = 3.94°) with HG ( M = -0.50°;  SD = 4.62°) and MG ( M = 0.23°; SD = 3.35°) did not reveal  any significant differences. In summary, for matching, during hypergravity position  errors increased significantly compared with 1G values,  while in microgravity they fell significantly. For pointing,  errors during hypergravity increased significantly, but the  fall in errors during microgravity failed to reach signifi - cance. By contrast, errors during repositioning showed no  significant changes during either increases or decreases in  gravity. In addition, the control values in normal gravity for  repositioning were significantly smaller than for pointing  (p <.003, 2tt). Discussion When we embarked on the present study, it was to ask  the question, did gravity influence position sense, no mat - ter what method of measurement was used (Weber and  Proske 2022 )? The present study has shown that for posi - tion sense measured by matching or pointing, changes in  gravity had significant effects on the measured values. For  Fig. 4  Matching, pointing and repositioning errors during the different  gravity episodes for 12 participants. Display of the mean errors (± SD,  shown by the error bars).

( 2012 ) that during parabolic flight reach - ing errors were made with changes in gravity. Participants  overshot the target in hypergravity and undershot it in  microgravity. Adding gravity-like torque, by means of elas - tic straps, stretched across the arm before and during the  movement, recovered participants’ performance in micro - gravity to resemble that in normal gravity. The authors  postulated that in microgravity the increased joint torque  generated by the elastic straps enhanced arm position sense.  One possible reason for this was an increase in skeletomotor  activity required to overcome the additional torque gener - ated by the straps and this would be accompanied by co- activated fusimotor activity that raised spindle discharges. We have suggested an alternate explanation. The normal  position signal, especially when generated near the flexion  or extension limits of a joint’s working range, is likely to  include inputs from both spindles and joint receptors (Pro - ske 2023 ; Proske and Weber 2023 ). Joint receptors have  an “activation angle” where they begin to generate a main - tained discharge, which in animal preparations is 15°-20°  short of the limit of movement at the joint. Therefore, when  a position is adopted, which is getting closer to the joint  limit, and the activation angle has been exceeded, there will  be signal mixing from two sources, stretched spindles and  activated joint receptors. The details have been spelt out in  Proske ( 2024a ). When hypergravity imposes extra torque on  the joint, the activation angle will be moved further towards  the middle of the movement range, increasing the opportu - nity for mixing, thereby raising the joint receptor component  of the position signal. In microgravity, if the arm becomes  weightless, there will be no standing torque on the joint and,  as a consequence, joint receptor input will fall, lowering  the position signal. Stretching elastic straps across the joint  would increase joint torque and raise the joint receptor com - ponent of the position signal. That, in turn, would recover  position sense values in microgravity to normal levels. To  further test these ideas we plan, in the future, to measure  position sense in microgravity with joint torque raised by  means of elastics stretched across the elbow joint. There is an interesting report by Motanova et al. ( 2022 )  describing construction of a “penguin axial loading suit”  for use in microgravity conditions. The purpose of the suit  was to create axial load, to help compensate for the lack of  proprioceptive afferent feedback in microgravity. The suit  incorporates a system of inbuilt elastic elements which are  distributed according to the demands of selected antagonist  muscle groups. The ideas underlying construction of such a  suit support our joint receptor hypothesis. In the present study, for pointing, the error values were  significantly larger than for matching (Fig. 4). Not only were  values larger during changes in gravity, but control errors at  1G were larger as well. A similar trend in the distribution linked in some way with the participation of spindles. That  conclusion strengthened our view that spindles played a key  role in the observed gravity-dependent changes in position  sense. In the present study, for matching and pointing there  were increases in errors in hypergravity and decreases in  microgravity. What might that mean? As mentioned, it is  believed that muscle spindles provide the position signal  during movements about a joint; an increase in spindle dis - charge signals a longer muscle, a more flexed or extended  joint (Matthews 1988 ). We suggest that there is a spindle  discharge - joint angle relation for the determination of  position sense, established during development (Held and  Bauer 1967 ). If, as a result of an increase in gravity, the  position signal increases, this would be expressed in both  arms, the reference arm sitting at 60° and the indicator  moved by the participant. Since the reference remains fixed  at the test angle, the signal coming from it would be higher  than expected from 1G values. The indicator would move  towards the position of the reference, until a point was  reached where the signals from the two arms matched. For  elbow flexors this would be a position where the indica - tor arm was more extended than the reference. If spindle  discharge in elbow flexors decreases in microgravity, this  would lead to a fall in position errors, producing values for  elbow extension below those for 1G levels. This argument does not consider the spindle signals in the  antagonist extensors. Presumably, in real life, it is the effect  of gravity on the balance of discharges in flexors and exten - sors which determines the direction of the errors. However,  in the present study, all of the errors for matching and point - ing were in the direction of elbow extension (Fig. 4), includ - ing the values in normal gravity, suggesting that the signal  coming from the flexors dominated the outcome. It could be argued that the smaller errors in micrograv - ity represented a more accurate measurement and not be a  disturbance at all. We propose that whenever the prevailing  spindle discharge rates are altered, up or down, away from  their normal 1G level, this should be seen as a disturbance.  These gravity-dependent alterations in the spindle rate: joint  angle relation lead the participant to perceive their arms in  positions which are unexpected and therefore makes them  unsure of the reliability of their movements when these are  made in the absence of vision. Here it should, perhaps, be remembered that there is  some evidence for gravity-based influences acting on posi - tion sense measured at ground level, under 1G conditions.  When participants were asked to judge elbow position with  respect to the vertical, they performed better than when  asked to focus on joint angles (Soechting 1982 ). Why should spindle discharges increase or decrease dur - ing gravity changes? In an arm reaching task it was shown  1 3Page 9 of 12 127 Experimental Brain Research (2025) 243:127The observations made in the present experiments sup - port the view that in repositioning there was no direct  involvement of spindles. Despite the significant changes in  gravity-dependent errors in matching and pointing, presum - ably mediated by changes in spindle afferent activity, for  repositioning, errors in both hypergravity and micrograv - ity remained non-significant. Furthermore, for reposition - ing, even the value during normal gravity was lower than  for pointing. We conclude that of the three methods, repo - sitioning was the most accurate and position sense values  remained unresponsive to changes in gravity, suggesting  that spindles played no role in this sense. Presumably, repo - sitioning values were generated entirely centrally. In the  future, we want to confirm this conclusion by repeating the  repositioning experiment, but carry out the memorizing and  repositioning stages in different gravity phases. We suggest that the instruction to the participant,  “Remember this angle”, leads them to focus their attention  on the position of the arm, which immediately provides  them with the precise angular information for that position.  A memory is triggered, expressed in terms of angles of joints  and lengths of muscles, but which, at the time of measure - ment, does not involve any ongoing spindle activity in arm  muscles. The memory is referred to a central storage site for  spatial information and kept there, ready for the instruction  to reproduce the remembered position. These ideas are, of  course, purely speculative and it is our intention to put them  to the test in future experiments. Looking more broadly, the present data support the view  that different methods of measuring position sense involve  fundamentally different underlying processes which will  impact the meaning of a particular measurement. This  is particularly relevant for the method of repositioning  which is the preferred method used in most proprioceptive  research and is widely employed in clinical settings. What  we are learning is that the three different methods of mea - suring position sense are all likely to have different underly - ing mechanisms and it could be argued that there are several  distinct position senses. There appear to be two sources of influence determining  human position sense. One is afferent signals of a periph - eral origin providing information about muscle lengths and  joint angles. The other is a central repository of recently  remembered information concerning position of the body  and its parts in egocentric and extrapersonal space, which  can be accessed to provide accurate spatial information  about limb position. The three methods of measurement  used in the present study seem to show a progressive transi - tion between these two influences; from one which relies  almost entirely on peripheral afferent information, two-arm  matching, to one that contains elements of both peripheral  and central influences, one-arm pointing, to one which is of pointing errors was observed by Roach et al. ( 2023 ). It  suggested that in normal gravity there was an offset, in the  direction of arm extension, in the measured values of point - ing errors. One possible explanation is that for pointing the  proprioceptive information coming from the hidden refer - ence arm must be converted to a visual frame of reference to  guide the pointing arm. Such a conversion comes with addi - tional errors when compared with a purely proprioceptive  measurement (Darling et al. 2024 ). We suggest that such an  offset was present in the parabolic measurements. A detailed  explanation for the size and direction of the offset remains  elusive. The question arises, do frame of reference considerations  also apply to two-arm matching? Here we have always  assumed that both arms were in the same postural frame  of reference (Velay et al. 1989 ). Certainly, the instructions  to the participants were always to align the position of one  arm with that of the other arm and no reference was made to  gravity. Evidence in support of two-arm matching operating  within a single frame of reference is the symmetrical distri - bution of thixotropic errors in both arms (Roach et al. 2023 ).  From another point of view, two-arm matching is consid - ered a low-level judgement, made within a single frame of  reference (Heroux et al., 2022 ). The findings for repositioning were rather different from  those for matching and pointing. The errors were all rather  small and there was no significant difference between posi - tion sense values during changes in gravity. Our original  working hypothesis for repositioning had been that when  a participant was asked to remember a chosen angle, the  spindle discharge generated in arm muscles at that angle  was stored in memory. Subsequently, when the participant  was asked to reposition the arm, the spindle discharge for  that angle was retrieved from memory and compared with  the ongoing level of activity, as the arm moved towards the  remembered angle, until the two matched. However, such an explanation turned out to be wrong!  The data of Roach et al. ( 2023 ) suggested that in reposition - ing ongoing spindle activity did not play a significant role.  It raised the possibility that in generating the position signal  the necessary information was likely derived from central  sources (Proske 2024b ). In support of that view, Roach et al.  (2023 ) did an additional experiment where they introduced  thixotropic disturbances after the memorizing stage and  before the reproduction stage. The data showed that this did  not alter repositioning errors. If spindles had been involved,  it should have led to increases in position errors. While we  cannot rule out participation of sensory receptors other than  spindles in the repositioning process, our current preferred  interpretation is that position information in repositioning  was largely derived from central sources (Proske 2024b ). 1 3127  Page 10 of 12 Experimental Brain Research (2025) 243:127if changes were made.

Gravity appears to exert an influence on position sense  only when there is evidence of a direct contribution from  spindles, as seen in matching and pointing. For reposition - ing it appears that the central influences predominate. What  is unexpected is the finding that the position values derived  centrally are more accurate than those which involve spin - dles. The concept of a central repository of position infor - mation operating independently of peripheral influences is  also novel. Presumably the stored information is acquired,  in part, through memories of past kinesthetic activities. To conclude, this study has raised a number of issues.  Does gravity exert its influence on position sense through  changes in torque levels at a joint, leading to an alteration  of the joint receptor component of the position signal? If  so, why is this not expressed in position sense measured by  repositioning? Assuming the existence of a body schema  as the central repository of spatial information, how is the  communication carried out between the body periphery and  central sites? Are spindles involved in this process? Given  that the three methods studied here measure essentially the  same thing, why are there such substantial differences in the  underlying mechanisms? If we are right and repositioning  operates substantially independently of peripheral sources  of positional information, what is the significance of that?  All of these issues will, hopefully, be addressed in future  experiments. Author contributions  Bernhard M.

In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration missions. Due to the loss of gravity sensing genes in the sister species Wolffia australiana , we also hypothesised for Wolffia globosa a lack of the gravity sensing mechanisms, resulting in a reduced effect of the different gravity levels on the growth and morphological characteristics. The different images show the implementation of the experimental hardware in the different gravity treatments.

Trehalose accumulation (Crowe et al. , 1998 ; Lapinski and Tunnacliffe, 2003 ), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins ( Goyal et al. , 2005 ; Kikawada et al. , 2006 ; MacRae, 2016 ), heat shock proteins (Cornette et al. , 2010 ; King and MacRae, 2015 ), and ROS scavenging ( Gusev et al. , 2010 ; Rizzo et al. , 2010 ) have been proposed as mechanisms of desiccation tolerance ( Janis et al. , 2018 ). We also investigated the tolerance to hyperosmotic stress by the expression of CAHS proteins, and found that the expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, or CAHS8 rendered the cells tolerant to the hyperosmotic stress. 2 and 3). (C–I) Representative images of HeLa cells overexpressing mEGFP (C), CAHS1- mEGFP (D), CAHS3-mEGFP (E), CAHS8-mEGFP (F), CAHS12-mEGFP (G), LEAM-mEGFP (H), and MAHS-mEGFP (I) proteins at the indicated time points. Although t-test was conducted for the data compared with the mEGFP data, the statistical significance was not observed.mEGFP protein, the CAHS3-mEGFP, the CAHS8-mEGFP, the CAHS12-mEGFP, the LEAM-mEGFP, the MAHS-mEGFP and the mEGFP were transfected into the HeLa cells with 293fectinTM Transfection Reagent (#12347-019, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). HeLa cells were plated on 96-well plates (7.5 × 102 – 3.0 × 103cells/well) (#167425, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and cultured in the assay medium for 24 h. To induce gene expression, the cells were treated with doxycycline for 24 h, followed by the treatment with sorbitol solution for 24 h. For the simultaneous cell viability assay and cell death assay ( Fig. Taken together, these results suggest that the resistance to hyperosmotic stress by LEAM and MAHS expression is not cell-wide protection as observed for CAHS proteins, so we focused on the CAHS proteins for our subsequent analyses.Osmotic stress resistance by CAHS1 expression Cell Structure and Function 49: 123–133 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1247/csf.24035 129 Cell Structure and FunctionCAHS1 expression renders HeLa cells resistant to hyperosmotic stress Recent studies have elucidated that the CAHS3 protein forms fibrillar aggregates under hyperosmotic conditions in mammalian cells, thereby enhancing their tolerance to hyperosmotic stress, as observed in Drosophila S2 cells ( Tanaka et al. , 2022 ). In addition, in this study, the single-cell clone of HeLa cells stably expressing CAHS1-mEGFP indicated lower IC50 values for cell viability and EC50 values for cell death in response to sorbitol stimulation in the absence of doxycycline than parental HeLa cells ( Fig. 2 and 3).  \n",
            "3  The results from this analysis highlight novel cellular Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 3 of 23 responses that may be relevant contributors to the combined e ects of microgravity and space radiation and therefore critical drivers of health risks from space radiation. The dose data for all spaceﬂight experiments, with the exception of GLDS-111, were from instruments available on the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. To compare the number of genes sets with the annotated gene sets, we provided heatmaps and clustering for all the datasets based on the NES for each molecular signature database collection for the analysis with the FDR <0.25 (Figure 4). To compare the number of genes sets with the annotated gene sets, we provided heatmaps and clustering for all the datasets based on the NES fo r each molecular signature database collection for the analysis with the FDR < 0.25 (Figure 4). Similar to the C5 GO analysis, we observed an increase in mitochondrial pathways as a function of dose. We observed these pathways to also be involved with our GSEA analysis as a function of dose. In our analysis on the C6 Oncogenic Signature database, we observed that PDGF and TGF were clustered together, purely on the basis of the statistics, and both were decreasing with increasing dose (cluster 3 in Figure 7C). The auto-annotated gene sets for each k-means cluster were then plotted with the NES versus the dose for associated for each GeneLab dataset (Table 1) with R-program ggplot2 (v3.2.1,).

A feature of the errors in pointing was that while increases in errors in HG and falls in MG were smaller relative to the NG value, compared with two-arm matching, all pointing errors lay further in the direction of extension of the arm, including the value for NG. For pointing and matching the trend of an increase in errors during hypergravity and a decrease during microgravity, relative to the normal gravity Data analysis For two-arm matching, the angles of the reference and indi - cator arms were recorded.

Our observations suggest that of the three methods used in the present study, with the method of repositioning, it is not possible to reveal any disturbance of position sense by gravity and that if gravity effects were to be studied further, the preferred methods to use would have to be matching or pointing. * p <.05; ** p <.01 1 3127 Page 8 of 12 Experimental Brain Research (2025) 243:127by Bringoux et al. ( 2012 ) that during parabolic flight reach - ing errors were made with changes in gravity. If, as a result of an increase in gravity, the position signal increases, this would be expressed in both arms, the reference arm sitting at 60° and the indicator moved by the participant. It suggested that in normal gravity there was an offset, in the direction of arm extension, in the measured values of point - ing errors. Certainly, the instructions to the participants were always to align the position of one arm with that of the other arm and no reference was made to gravity.  \n",

In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration missions. Due to the loss of gravity sensing genes in the sister species Wolffia australiana , we also hypothesised for Wolffia globosa a lack of the gravity sensing mechanisms, resulting in a reduced effect of the different gravity levels on the growth and morphological characteristics. The different images show the implementation of the experimental hardware in the different gravity treatments.

Trehalose accumulation (Crowe et al. , 1998 ; Lapinski and Tunnacliffe, 2003 ), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins ( Goyal et al. , 2005 ; Kikawada et al. , 2006 ; MacRae, 2016 ), heat shock proteins (Cornette et al. , 2010 ; King and MacRae, 2015 ), and ROS scavenging ( Gusev et al. , 2010 ; Rizzo et al. , 2010 ) have been proposed as mechanisms of desiccation tolerance ( Janis et al. , 2018 ). We also investigated the tolerance to hyperosmotic stress by the expression of CAHS proteins, and found that the expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, or CAHS8 rendered the cells tolerant to the hyperosmotic stress. 2 and 3). (C–I) Representative images of HeLa cells overexpressing mEGFP (C), CAHS1- mEGFP (D), CAHS3-mEGFP (E), CAHS8-mEGFP (F), CAHS12-mEGFP (G), LEAM-mEGFP (H), and MAHS-mEGFP (I) proteins at the indicated time points. Although t-test was conducted for the data compared with the mEGFP data, the statistical significance was not observed.mEGFP protein, the CAHS3-mEGFP, the CAHS8-mEGFP, the CAHS12-mEGFP, the LEAM-mEGFP, the MAHS-mEGFP and the mEGFP were transfected into the HeLa cells with 293fectinTM Transfection Reagent (#12347-019, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). HeLa cells were plated on 96-well plates (7.5 × 102 – 3.0 × 103cells/well) (#167425, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and cultured in the assay medium for 24 h. To induce gene expression, the cells were treated with doxycycline for 24 h, followed by the treatment with sorbitol solution for 24 h. For the simultaneous cell viability assay and cell death assay ( Fig. Taken together, these results suggest that the resistance to hyperosmotic stress by LEAM and MAHS expression is not cell-wide protection as observed for CAHS proteins, so we focused on the CAHS proteins for our subsequent analyses.Osmotic stress resistance by CAHS1 expression Cell Structure and Function 49: 123–133 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1247/csf.24035 129 Cell Structure and FunctionCAHS1 expression renders HeLa cells resistant to hyperosmotic stress Recent studies have elucidated that the CAHS3 protein forms fibrillar aggregates under hyperosmotic conditions in mammalian cells, thereby enhancing their tolerance to hyperosmotic stress, as observed in Drosophila S2 cells ( Tanaka et al. , 2022 ). In addition, in this study, the single-cell clone of HeLa cells stably expressing CAHS1-mEGFP indicated lower IC50 values for cell viability and EC50 values for cell death in response to sorbitol stimulation in the absence of doxycycline than parental HeLa cells ( Fig. 2 and 3).  \n",
            "3  The results from this analysis highlight novel cellular Cancers 2020 ,12, 381 3 of 23 responses that may be relevant contributors to the combined e ects of microgravity and space radiation and therefore critical drivers of health risks from space radiation. The dose data for all spaceﬂight experiments, with the exception of GLDS-111, were from instruments available on the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. To compare the number of genes sets with the annotated gene sets, we provided heatmaps and clustering for all the datasets based on the NES for each molecular signature database collection for the analysis with the FDR <0.25 (Figure 4). To compare the number of genes sets with the annotated gene sets, we provided heatmaps and clustering for all the datasets based on the NES fo r each molecular signature database collection for the analysis with the FDR < 0.25 (Figure 4). Similar to the C5 GO analysis, we observed an increase in mitochondrial pathways as a function of dose. We observed these pathways to also be involved with our GSEA analysis as a function of dose. In our analysis on the C6 Oncogenic Signature database, we observed that PDGF and TGF were clustered together, purely on the basis of the statistics, and both were decreasing with increasing dose (cluster 3 in Figure 7C). The auto-annotated gene sets for each k-means cluster were then plotted with the NES versus the dose for associated for each GeneLab dataset (Table 1) with R-program ggplot2 (v3.2.1,).

A feature of the errors in pointing was that while increases in errors in HG and falls in MG were smaller relative to the NG value, compared with two-arm matching, all pointing errors lay further in the direction of extension of the arm, including the value for NG. For pointing and matching the trend of an increase in errors during hypergravity and a decrease during microgravity, relative to the normal gravity Data analysis For two-arm matching, the angles of the reference and indi - cator arms were recorded.

Our observations suggest that of the three methods used in the present study, with the method of repositioning, it is not possible to reveal any disturbance of position sense by gravity and that if gravity effects were to be studied further, the preferred methods to use would have to be matching or pointing. * p <.05; ** p <.01 1 3127 Page 8 of 12 Experimental Brain Research (2025) 243:127by Bringoux et al. ( 2012 ) that during parabolic flight reach - ing errors were made with changes in gravity. If, as a result of an increase in gravity, the position signal increases, this would be expressed in both arms, the reference arm sitting at 60° and the indicator moved by the participant. It suggested that in normal gravity there was an offset, in the direction of arm extension, in the measured values of point - ing errors. Certainly, the instructions to the participants were always to align the position of one arm with that of the other arm and no reference was made to gravity.  \n"

Considering that morphology plays a crucial role in plant growth, survival, and  productivity46, we investigated  the effect of different gravitational treatments on the shape of Wolffia globosa frond. This genetic difference suggests that Wolffia  species have evolved alternative mechanisms  to perceive and respond to gravity cues, which may explain the distinct growth patterns exhibited under altered  gravitational conditions.

The cDNAs of R. varieornatus  CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, CAHS12, LEAM, and MAHS were synthesized with codon optimization for the human genome using gBlocks Gene Fragments (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) and inserted into the pCAGGS vector ( Niwa et al. , 1991 ) for transient expression experiments ( Fig. The cDNAs of rtTA ( Roney et al. , 2016 ) synthesized by FASMAC, tet-response element, and multiple cloning sites were inserted into a Tol2 donor vector by ligation and Gibson assembly to generate pTol2puro-rtTA2-TRE-MCS.

One day after loading into the microfluidic chamber, the cells were imaged with a spinning disk conformal microscope to visualize the subcellular distribution of these fusion proteins upon hyperosmotic stress such as 0.5 M sorbitol or 0.2 M NaCl ( Fig. Although the p-value ( p = 0.058 for CAHS1 compared with mEGFP) indicated that the observed difference  was not statistically significant,  the data suggest a potential trend toward increased resistance to osmotic stress through CAHS1 expression, which may warrant further investigation. Conclusion In this study, we expressed R. varieornatus  CAHS proteins in HeLa cells to investigate their effects  on resistance to hyper- osmotic stress, an early step in anhydrobiosis.
